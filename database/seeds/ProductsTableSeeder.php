Without some kind of case protection a naked phone wouldn’t last six months depending on the severity of chemical baths. So where is the cost-cutting savings? It is delivered by protecting that mobile investment with the industry’s first medical-grade, fully-enclosed battery backup case. These mobile pocket computers are positioned to replace expensive computer work stations and the all additional peripherals they require, including barcode scanning hardware. Everything can be charted, verified, scanned (using soft-scanning software and camera on that mobile device), re-verified, and documented all from a single mobile device running a mobile HIS or system.</p><p>If you are looking to mobilize your healthcare enterprise and deploy iPhone 7 or 8 devices the CR7000 cases are always PVC-free and built with CodeShield® disinfectant-ready plastics. The Dragontrail™ shatter-proof glass delivers the screen touch sensitivity you need while fully enclosing and protecting the smartphone from the bacteria and viruses trying to hitch a ride. Fully-enclosed means fully-protected unlike consumer-grade cases trying to fit this space.</p><p>Code offers two product models in the CR7000 series to choose from. The CR7018 which features BatteryTrak™ and the CR7019 that offers data pass-through and single sign on capability. Both models offer easily swappable, external batteries that more than doubles the life of your phone and a flexible battery charging system that includes options like a 5 or 10-bay battery cradle that can be mounted horizontally or vertically to fit any workspace. These chargers provide a clear indication of each battery’s charge status eliminating the guess work on which battery to grab and get back to work.</p>',

The first would be the increased efficiency mobility offers point-of-care teams, and the second is the fact that mobility offers healthcare teams the opportunity to cut significant costs. Increased efficiency and saving money, is there a catch? Yes, a big one and it’s called patient safety.</p>',
