Legal cannabis companies must:</p><ul><li>Sell only products that have passed full compliance</li><li>Ensure all products are properly packaged and labeled</li><li>Comply with all potency limits</li></ul><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/472/IMG_1353.jpg" alt="Small marijuana plants on wall shelves"></figure><p>Though few companies oppose the regulation, the problem cannabis companies face is massive–with so few labs to test product and such a short time to ensure full compliance there is bound to be millions in product that can’t be sold wrapped in red tape. Inventory that just sits is profit lost. Inventory not in compliance means it can’t be legally sold. Moreover, being found out of compliance can bring crippling fines anywhere from $8,000 to as high as $250,000. The problem often leaves businesses at a cash flow stand-off, so what is a company to do? How can the rest of the country, whether legal or working on it, ensure they won\'t be caught off guard when shifts in the regulatory landscape happen?</p><p>Pharma and medical device might hold some valuable lessons:</p><ul><li>Establish and maintain your pipeline–this means you should find the right suppliers, distributors, and labs, but more importantly ensure you have an open dialogue with them so when regulatory changes come your companies can move together. Keeping strong supply relationships can make or break a company.</li><li>Ensure your company is following a supply and inventory strategy that fits. You might not need to go full Toyota Lean, but it is important to understand the different types of inventory strategies used to keep inventory to a minimum, ensuring that if a regulation does change you won\'t be stuck with unusable product. Spend some time researching Just-in-Time (JIT) inventory management, Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), and Material Requirements Planning (MRP) inventory strategies. You don\'t have to have an MBA to ensure you have the best supply chain, but small changes could have&nbsp;an enormous impact on your profits.</li><li>Bring what you can control in-house–something as simple as a label printer could mean the difference between sales today, and having to wait weeks for custom order labels. Costs might be a bit higher on the front end, but if regulations shift something simple as font, content or even color, can derail supply chains for weeks as everyone scrambles to order new labels.</li><li>Keep an eye on the laws–the most obvious of course, but it is easy to get mired down in the day to day of running a business and get blindsided by a change that could have been planned for weeks, or months in advance. This could be as simple as reading the latest news, or becoming a part of a local or national cannabis organization, and still save you both time and money.</li></ul><p>These are just a few short tips that could help, but in such a volatile market it is important always to be exploring ways to improve your business. There are many strategies out there that are easily integrated into your cannabis business structure. Growers, processors, distributors, or any combination of the three can seriously benefit from planning ahead and taking a look outside your market to see what has worked for others.</p><p>The right equipment can help you future-proof your processes and workflow saving valuable time and money.&nbsp; Saving money in your seed-2-sale process is as simple as finding the right solution.</p>',

Even our most mundane functions have been altered — possibly permanently — and we are struggling to figure out how to adapt to this new reality. For those in retail, finding ways to encourage customers to shop must be weighed against keeping those customers and store employees safe. Requirements for masks and social distancing are with us and part of the new retail environment, at least for the short term. &nbsp;Smart retailers are looking for long-term solutions to help make the shopping experience safer for people on both sides of the register.</p><p>There are many steps that retail stores can begin incorporating that will benefit employees and customers during this period of adjustment. But what changes can be made for the longer term? One small adjustment that can make a big difference is the barcode scanner used in the store. Barcode scanning is a common part of retail and a few simple things can make the use of the barcode scanning system safer and more efficient.</p><h2>Efficiency and Safety</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most barcode scanners designed for retail are a simple collection of plastic housing parts, circuitry, software, and the glass. They are designed to perform basic functions, over and over, throughout the workday. This limited functionality was fine in the past, but to remain successful, businesses need an edge. Scanners can be useful in many store areas and can perform several helpful functions. Scanners can be used to check-in inventory, determine inventory levels, scan merchandise details, and record prices. They can also check identification for age-restricted purchases or a registration in customer loyalty programs.</p><p>The right scanner can also help protect the health and well-being of employees. Code offers scanners made from CodeShield plastics. These housings are capable of withstanding frequent cleanings from the harshest hospital chemical cleaners and disinfectants. Retail stores are now able to provide cleaning and disinfecting of their day-to-day scanners with medical-grade cleaners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

So how do you decide what you need? Well, you do just a little bit of research. Before you purchased your business software, safe, processing equipment, and so on, I am betting you did your due diligence.</p><p>Did you know that there are barcode scanning solutions that do more than scan a UPC check-out code?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-5000/">One example is the Code Reader™5025 a scanner&nbsp;</a>that can check out your customer’s purchase and also be used for age verification. What about the new Federally mandated&nbsp;<strong>Real ID</strong>? Most scanners are not able to read this complex PDF417 code format. The right barcode scanners powered by the best decoding technology can. Not only can the CR5025 read this complex barcode format and parse the information into your system so employees never have to type out a single thing–advanced versions can even notify employees if a license is expired or the patron is underage.&nbsp;<strong>A nice double-check to have in such a regulated space.</strong></p><h2><strong>Looking for complete mobility at your dispensary?</strong></h2><p>Then Bluetooth connectivity,&nbsp;<a href="https://tachyoniq.com/software-solutions/cortexwedge/">a keyboard wedge</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://tachyoniq.com/software-solutions/">software scanning app integration</a>&nbsp;(from Code\'s software brand TachyonIQ™) could also be an option. The key takeaway here is that the scanning technology (be it hardware or software based) is what makes the difference in purchasing a solution or a band-aid. The same holds true for all aspects of your cannabis business when you do the research you ensure that the investment you make can offer a solution that makes your job easier and your business more efficient.</p><p>No matter your system or your state, you have to track your product from the time it sprouts, or as soon as it enters your doors.&nbsp;<strong>There can be no gap in custody.</strong>&nbsp;When there are issues with barcode quality, including dirt or damage, light, color, or code contrast, the barcode decoding technology can make the job easy or render the device useless. Code has spent decades perfecting its decoding algorithm.&nbsp;<strong>Data capture and decoding is all we do.</strong>&nbsp;Where other companies split their time, energy, and money being all things to everyone,&nbsp;<strong>we remain hyper-focused on delivering the best decoding technology, and it shows.</strong></p><h2><strong>Barcodes have been around for decades.</strong></h2><p>Early on, businesses struggled with inconsistency and inefficiency. The tendency for human error made inventory and check-out a tedious process. With profits parading out the front door, barcode solutions offered business the ability to optimize workflows and retain profits. Who would have thought that such a little thing could make such a big difference? Barcodes can be coded to hold all sorts of information, not just a string of numbers, but names, dates, and even executable code. High quality, feature-rich barcode readers can also perform macro tasks for you, parsing information into various fields and pages within your programs–executing commands and even validating information.</p><h2><strong>Let’s talk solutions.</strong></h2><p>In the end, it is essential to understand what&nbsp;your business needs and where it is going. Barcodes might be 1D, but moderns IDs, QR codes used in customer loyalty, and future labels will require advanced 2D functionality. Purchasing a barcode scanner with the built-in ability to decode any barcode symbology with zero-miss efficiency only makes sense.&nbsp;<strong>To plan for the future with the single best purchase, or be forced into buying twice.</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codecorp.com/">Compare prices and see, the future-proof data capture answer starts with Code.</a></p>',

Pang shows how great athletes, musicians, and performers mix up intensive sessions of “work” accompanied by periods of rest to allow their bodies, minds, and spirits to recover and regenerate. If you push too hard for too long, you are susceptible to burnout and related stress, anxiety, and depression.</p><p>It’s tough to be productive or innovative when you feel like all you do is slave over a computer or attend meetings. That degree of intensity isn’t conducive to problem-solving or innovating.</p><h4><strong>Real Balance</strong></h4><p>At Code, we approach the idea of work/life balance from a holistic point of view. We’ve created workspaces that are designed to help you be more comfortable and for maximizing your work with other Code employees, such as height-adjusting desks, ergonomic chairs, and lots of natural light to keep your body in rhythm with the outside world.</p><p>We also have a beautiful break area where you can meet informally with others, work in a different setting, or spend your lunch in comfort without having to go out for fast food. Big refrigerators, an ice machine, filtered water, a specialty coffee machine, free drinks, snacks, and cereal are all available to take some of the stress out of your daily work life.</p><h4><strong>Play On</strong></h4><p>As if those weren’t enough, we encourage you to play! We’ve got ping-pong and corn hole to work off some of that tension, and we get some wicked tournaments going. We have a video gaming station with new releases and some classics as well.

            'page_text' => '<p>In the healthcare industry, tracking, tracing, and verifying lab samples can be a complicated and vulnerable process. With the amount and variety of shipments moving in, out, and about hospitals and labs, ensuring that the correct samples get where they need to be and back again can be difficult and stressful. Utilizing industry-trusted, high-performing barcode scanners and software is paramount for ensuring patient safety and accuracy throughout this process. Code has developed a line of enterprise-level scanning solutions to help you improve the efficiency of your hospital. <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/healthcare-datacapture/">See for yourself how Code can help you track, trace, and verify with precision and ease</a>.</p><h2><strong>Track Lab Samples with Ease</strong></h2><p>Healthcare providers need to have an efficient way of taking and tracking patient samples. In the fast-paced environment of the healthcare industry, hospital workers need equipment that can quickly and reliably gather information so that more of their time can be spent on diagnosing and analyzing problems. It’s also important that samples be taken right the first time. Compromised samples require additional resources and can subject patients to more discomfort, or in extreme cases, create a life or death matter for patients. Code readers ensure that patient samples can be taken quickly and tracked reliably.</p><p>Code’s disinfectant-ready readers will withstand the harsh chemicals necessary for cleaning and sanitizing. This means that healthcare workers won’t have to worry about breaking the reader during sanitation. Nurses and doctors can transport readers in and out of patients’ rooms without worrying about bringing harmful bacteria with them.</p><h2><strong>Trace Lab Samples with Accuracy</strong></h2><p>Being able to trace a sample from patient to lab and then back to the correct patient is a delicate process. For patient safety, it is imperative that samples aren’t misidentified. A patient’s entire welfare relies on accurate IDs and the successful match-up between records and samples.</p><p>Integrating Code readers into a lab’s workflow significantly reduces the likelihood of misidentified samples. Code’s Bluetooth-capable readers can transmit data from patient wristbands to devices like a mobile printer without messy cables or cords. Mobile printers can be used to print unique barcode labels for hospital workers to stick onto blood bags, urine samples, and record sheets to trace important information and updates and keep patient information unified and organized. Code readers don’t rely on manual entry for sensitive data; instead, they read barcodes automatically and parse the information into simple-to-understand formats for nurses and doctors.</p><h2><strong>Verify Lab Samples with Confidence</strong></h2><p>In order to efficiently track and trace lab samples, medical teams need to verify that samples are studied holistically to give patients the very best health recommendations possible. To accomplish this, doctors need a system that categorizes patient information and organizes samples appropriately. Since most of this patient information is highly sensitive and private, the federal government strictly regulates how hospitals keep track of and verify samples. For this reason, healthcare teams have to be extremely meticulous in using equipment and software to protect their patient information.</p><p>Code readers allow hospital staff to scan data and transmit it into health information software (for more information on how Code’s software solution, click here). With patient information just a few clicks away, nurses and doctors can determine the type and number of samples to take and the results of a sample analysis broken down on a desktop computer or mobile device. Code scanners also adapt to multiple types of health information systems using JavaScript. Scanning, organizing, and reading data doesn’t get much easier.</p><p>Code readers offer the healthcare industry the best solution for managing data samples. Tracking, tracing, and verifying are integral parts of a hospital staff’s daily workflow. <a href="https://info.codecorp.com/blog/healthcare-wins-and-workflow-solutions-include-code-technology">Code’s line of barcode scanners developed specifically for the healthcare industry make this process smooth, simple, and reliable</a>.</p>',

While consumer devices are a cost effective alternative to a traditional point of sale terminal, they are often designed with limited or zero USB ports. This makes it impossible to plug in a barcode reader, which requires business owners to work around the problem with expensive battery-powered, wireless scanners.</p><p>Code has a better solution: the T500 Cable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The T500 enables Code wired barcode readers to communicate to virtually any mobile device, including: iPad, Galaxy Tab, and Windows Surface, </strong>along with other devices that lack the USB and RS232 ports found on legacy PC-based POS systems.&nbsp;And because the T500 draws power directly from a standard AC wall outlet, battery replacement is a non-factor.</p><h2><strong>How it Works</strong></h2><p>Until now, cable options for wired barcode readers have been limited to USB or RS232 communication and were plugged directly into a port on a host device. Because the T500 cable has an embedded modem, when plugged into a Code wired barcode reader and powered on, it allows the reader to communicate to other Bluetooth-enabled devices via radio waves.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/463/6a7067.jpg"></figure><p>Now you can connect your barcode reader to your tablet the same way you would connect your Beats Pill or other Bluetooth speaker to listen to your tunes.

            'page_text' => '<p>Dec 10, 2018</p><h2><strong>Barcodes keep our officers and the public safe by speeding up data collection and ensuring accuracy.</strong></h2><p>We often take the safety of our community and daily lives for granted, which means we don’t always think about the risks our troopers face when they get into their cruisers to protect the peace. Human behavior is tough to predict and control, and each time a trooper exits their cruiser—whether for a traffic violation or an event—their lives are immediately at risk. Studies have shown that the longer troopers are outside of their cruisers, the more their safety is compromised.</p><p>With the right equipment, police officers and other public safety professionals can automate and simplify their processes, which allows them to get out of harm’s way faster. <strong>Because barcode scanning can take a task of minutes down to seconds, it has become a valuable asset to public safety processes and is now a fixture in cruisers, offices, courts, and elsewhere.</strong></p><h2><strong>Workflow Issues in Law Enforcement</strong></h2><p><strong>1. Time Per Traffic Stop</strong></p><p>&nbsp;When attending to an incident, troopers return to their cruisers to enter driver license information. Manual entry of information into police database applications can take troopers more than three minutes and opens up the potential for data inaccuracies like misidentification, spelling errors, etc. Within these three minutes, anything could happen. The violator may decide to prematurely leave the scene of the incident, pull out a weapon, or engage in other risky behavior—endangering themselves, the trooper, and the lives of others.</p><p>According to the Utah Department of Public Safety, there were 272,783 traffic stops on Utah highways in 2014 and slightly more than half of them resulted in a citation (1). Depending on the state and the jurisdiction, the officer still may be required to take the driver’s information even if they are only issuing a warning. Let’s imagine the troopers took information for all 272,783 people when they pulled them over. With three minutes of typing per person, that would take at least 13,639 hours or 568 days of typing data that year—and that is just in Utah.</p><p><strong>2. Data Parsing of Driver Licenses</strong> Another workflow problem that is seen in public safety is the parsing of ID card information. In a typical workflow process there is often more than one application that is used to store information. There may be one type of application for entering data in a patrol officer’s car and another in the office and so on. If officers are manually entering the data into each separate application, the time gets compounded for each incident.</p><p>Driver licenses or ID cards from other states create another data parsing problem. Manual data entry of information from out-of-state ID cards may take more time because the layout of those cards varies from state to state.</p><p><strong>3. Errors as a Result of Manual Data Entry</strong> A big issues at traffic stops is the potential for error and misidentification that stems from manual data entry. If a trooper misspells something or doesn’t enter enough information, the system could potentially pull up the wrong person. This in turn could put the violation on the wrong record altogether, which would cause inaccuracies, legal issues, and a substantial amount of time and effort to fix.</p><p><strong>4. Inventory Control and Evidence Tracking</strong> According to Bob Gavin of Police Magazine, “Managing evidence is one of law enforcement\'s most critical tasks. Yet for thousands of police agencies it\'s overwhelming due to insufficient or no training, rotating personnel, low priority from administrators, and inadequate evidence tracking methods” (2). Keeping inventory of evidence is a huge part of public safety. Evidence can make or break a case, and it could be detrimental if it isn’t kept somewhere where it is accurately tracked and safe.</p><h2><strong>Why Barcode Scanning Solves Workflow Issues in Law Enforcement</strong></h2><p><strong>1. Less Time Per Traffic Stop</strong> If troopers have a reliable, high-performing barcode scanner in their cruiser, there is no need for manual data entry. They can scan the back of driver licenses and the data will automatically sync into their application. This will ensure that they have more time to keep their eyes on the scene of the incident and get out of potentially risky situations faster. <strong>With barcode scanners, the three or more minutes of manual data entry can be reduced to less than 30 seconds.</strong></p><p><strong>2. Accurate Data Parsing</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Because most public safety processes use more than one data-entry application through the entire workflow, utilizing a barcode scanner that can reliably parse information into each and every application will save time, reduce stress, and increase safety.</p><p>It is essential that officers have a barcode scanning solution that <strong>can parse data from driver licenses from every state including digital IDs.</strong> If the scanner does this, troopers won’t have to search out-of-state licenses for all of the corresponding information and manually enter it into their application.</p><p><strong>3. Fewer Errors</strong> A barcode scanner is <strong>a reliable, accurate way to enter data</strong> into an application. When utilizing a barcode scanner, errors and misidentification won’t be an issue since all of the needed information is entered into the system automatically without typos or misspellings.</p><p><strong>4. Improved Controls on Evidence and Inventory</strong> Using barcodes for evidence and inventory allows public safety professionals to create <strong>automated tracking systems that accurately track and control what goes in and out</strong>. This is a reliable and efficient way to make sure evidence is kept where it is needed and inventory levels are always maintained.</p><h2><strong>The Solution is Simple with Code</strong></h2><p>RETAIL-isolated-product-images copyIntroducing barcodes and barcode readers into public safety processes will improve performance and free up troopers and staff to focus on the situation at hand.

Hardly a day goes by that tech news, and even the evening news, don’t have something to say about algorithms and their impact on the modern world. So what, exactly, is an algorithm and why is it so important?</p><h3><strong>What are Algorithms?</strong></h3><p>Algorithms consist of bits of programming language used for calculation, data capture and processing, and automated reasoning. They make up the step-by-step, mathematical instructions that guide the calculations used by computers of all kinds. From your microwave and cell phone, to the automated manufacturing that built your car, to the International Space Station, algorithms guide the circuits and programming that surround us. The bright minds of computer scientists around the world create and launch these informational wonders.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/469/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f616c616e2d747572696e672d393531323031372d312d3430322e6a7067.jpg"></figure><p>The emergence of algorithms, and their use with automation, date back to the amazing Alan Turing and his work with computational theory. Turing\'s work during World War II resulted in the machine which ultimately broke the German Enigma code. The 2014 movie <i><strong>The Immitation Game</strong></i> chronicled Turing\'s struggles and ultimate success at cracking the impenetrable code.</p><h3><strong>How are Algorithms Used?</strong></h3><p>At Code, algorithms, in part, make us successful. In barcoding, two components work together for reading a barcode: the barcode scanning tool, and the algorithms that make it work. The barcode scanner comes in different types: from pen-type readers to laser scanners, to camera-based, to CCD readers, or omni-directional scanners. Each of these fits a niche in the role of scanning. None of these works without the accompanying software to make sense of what’s being scanned. The software, driven by algorithms, makes sense of the lines, squares, and dots captured by the scanner.</p><p>Much like other types of software, the algorithms used for scanning require precision and reliability time after time. The algorithms developed by Code trace their evolution from Alan Turing’s work during WWII. They read and interpret a code that contains valuable data.</p><p>Barcodes hold a wide range of data. Names, addresses, values for goods, medical information, instructions for use, destinations, dates, and much more can be contained within those lines, squares, and dots. Using the barcode to store large amounts of information in a small, easy to read space saves both time and money, and they work as a security measure as well. In order to access the details contained within the printed barcode, you need a barcode scanner with the proper software. The hardware captures the image, but the software – specifically the algorithm – changes the image into meaningful information.</p><h3><strong>Do Algorithms Make Barcode Scanning Better?</strong></h3><p>Many of the imaging software programs for barcode readers have a limited range and ability. A high percentage of scanners read only a few of the existing barcodes styles. Others can interpret a greater percentage of barcodes, but they struggle to read torn, faded, or misprinted labels, or labels on curved or reflective surfaces.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/471/4c65692e706e67.png"></figure><p>Code’s product development team creates a broad offering of scanners designed to meet the needs of healthcare, manufacturing, inventory management, OEM, retail, and more.

With the amount and variety of shipments moving in, out, and about hospitals and labs, ensuring that the correct samples get where they need to be and back again can be difficult and stressful. Utilizing industry-trusted, high-performing barcode scanners and software is paramount for ensuring patient safety and accuracy throughout this process. Code has developed a line of enterprise-level scanning solutions to help you improve the efficiency of your hospital.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/healthcare-datacapture/">See for yourself how Code can help you track, trace, and verify with precision and ease</a></p><p>.</p><h2><strong>Track Lab Samples with Ease</strong></h2><p>Healthcare providers need to have an efficient way of taking and tracking patient samples. In the fast-paced environment of the healthcare industry, hospital workers need equipment that can quickly and reliably gather information so that more of their time can be spent on diagnosing and analyzing problems. It’s also important that samples be taken right the first time. Compromised samples require additional resources and can subject patients to more discomfort, or in extreme cases, create a life or death matter for patients. Code readers ensure that patient samples can be taken quickly and tracked reliably.</p><p>Code’s disinfectant-ready readers will withstand the harsh chemicals necessary for cleaning and sanitizing. This means that healthcare workers won’t have to worry about breaking the reader during sanitation. Nurses and doctors can transport readers in and out of patients’ rooms without worrying about bringing harmful bacteria with them.</p><h2><strong>Trace Lab Samples with Accuracy</strong></h2><p>Being able to trace a sample from patient to lab and then back to the correct patient is a delicate process. For patient safety, it is imperative that samples aren’t misidentified. A patient’s entire welfare relies on accurate IDs and the successful match-up between records and samples.</p><p>Integrating Code readers into a lab’s workflow significantly reduces the likelihood of misidentified samples. Code’s Bluetooth-capable readers can transmit data from patient wristbands to devices like a mobile printer without messy cables or cords. Mobile printers can be used to print unique barcode labels for hospital workers to stick onto blood bags, urine samples, and record sheets to trace important information and updates and keep patient information unified and organized. Code readers don’t rely on manual entry for sensitive data; instead, they read barcodes automatically and parse the information into simple-to-understand formats for nurses and doctors.</p><h2><strong>Verify Lab Samples with Confidence</strong></h2><p>In order to efficiently track and trace lab samples, medical teams need to verify that samples are studied holistically to give patients the very best health recommendations possible. To accomplish this, doctors need a system that categorizes patient information and organizes samples appropriately. Since most of this patient information is highly sensitive and private, the federal government strictly regulates how hospitals keep track of and verify samples. For this reason, healthcare teams have to be extremely meticulous in using equipment and software to protect their patient information.</p><p>Code readers allow hospital staff to scan data and transmit it into health information software (for more information on how Code’s software solution, click here). With patient information just a few clicks away, nurses and doctors can determine the type and number of samples to take and the results of a sample analysis broken down on a desktop computer or mobile device. Code scanners also adapt to multiple types of health information systems using JavaScript. Scanning, organizing, and reading data doesn’t get much easier.</p><p>Code readers offer the healthcare industry the best solution for managing data samples. Tracking, tracing, and verifying are integral parts of a hospital staff’s daily workflow. <a href="https://info.codecorp.com/blog/healthcare-wins-and-workflow-solutions-include-code-technology">Code’s line of barcode scanners developed specifically for the healthcare industry make this process smooth, simple, and reliable</a>.</p>',

Having previously implemented a barcoded Bedside Medication Administration (BMA) process with Code’s wireless barcode readers, they had the foundation for Code’s Application Engineering team to create an effective barcoded EBM verification solution using Code\'s impressive CR2000 series product line.</p><h2><strong>Application Process</strong></h2><p>As part of their BMA process, patients admitted to Legacy Health System hospitals receive a unique bar coded patient identification wristband. Throughout the patient’s hospital stay, nurses and staff rely on a Code <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-2600/">CR2600,</a> or <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-2700/">CR2700</a> series wireless barcode reader to positively identify a patient before medications are administered. Expectant mothers receive a sheet of matching barcode labels (master barcode labels) for placement on EBM bottles. The baby also receives a matching barcoded wristband upon arrival, and the unit floor station receives a matching barcode label sheet (verification barcode labels) as well. Once the mother expresses breast milk, she places a master barcode label on the bottle. Clinicians remove the bottle and place it in refrigerated storage. At a later time, a clinician retrieves the EBM bottle, scans the master barcode label placed on it, and then scans the verification barcode label the unit received when the mother was admitted. The Code Reader beeps once for a positive patient identification match and three times for a negative patient ID match.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9b145b085fe259c240cd0ce2f78b1826d38c7764/68747470733a2f2f7777772e636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30352f6272656173742d6d696c6b2d323030783330302e6a7067" alt="breast milk"></figure><p>For a positive match, the clinician follows the feeding schedule as prescribed and creates individual smaller ounce EBM bottles, placing a label from the unit’s verification barcode label sheet on the new, smaller individual bottles. The bottles are then returned to refrigerated storage. At the time of feeding, the clinician retrieves the newly labeled EBM bottle and follows the hospitals BMA process. This includes logging into the Health Information System (HIS), scanning the baby’s barcoded patient ID wristband, then scanning the verification barcode label placed on the smaller EBM bottle. The HIS system alerts the clinician if the EBM matches, or does not match, the baby’s barcoded wristband to ensure the baby receives the correct bottle. All of this can take place at the bedside for speed and efficiency.</p><h2><strong>Avoiding Workarounds</strong></h2><p>To ensure clinicians follow the EBM verification process, supervisors connect and download via Bluetooth to retrieve each <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-2600/">CR2600,</a> or <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-2700/">CR2700</a> scanner workflow history. Clinicians scan a ‘check in’ bar code at the start of each shift which indicates to the supervisor who the clinician on duty is. In addition, supervices can identify check-in history, the last eight EBM verification attempts, the results of each attempt, and the length of time passed from check-in to a verification attempt. The data allows supervisors to visually verify procedures are being followed.</p><h2><strong>Application Benefits</strong></h2><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bb5e932c71b6d9888d0e48c13a6d974911a6cd30/68747470733a2f2f7777772e636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30352f6272656173742d6d696c6b322e6a7067" alt="breast milk2"></figure><p>Feeding a baby the wrong mother’s breast milk exposes the baby to potential health risks. Considering the number of feedings delivered and the multiple steps in handling EBM, more and more hospitals recognize the need for implementing a positive patient identification workflow matching EBM to both mother and child and eliminating the health risks.</p><h2><strong>Why Code Readers</strong></h2><p>Code builds readers specifically for the healthcare arena.

These variables affect the quality, safety, efficiency, and bottom-line profit margins for companies large and small. Identifying process weak points, monitoring inventory statuses, forecasting production flow, and hundreds of other workflow processes can be tracked and facilitate real-time decision making for management teams nationwide. Data capture makes all this possible.</p><p><i><strong>Code is here to help!</strong></i></p><h2><strong>How Did We Get Here?</strong></h2><p>Before there were barcodes, it was a Wild, Wild West of sorts in the world of tracking manufacturing production and workflow. The UPC label didn’t show up as a viable option until the 1970s. Even then, it was mainly used and developed for retail. The first item ever scanned for purchase by a barcode scanner (which is widely, <a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_892778">yet incorrectly</a>, believed to be sitting in the Smithsonian) was a 10-pack of Wrigley’s Juicy Fruit chewing gum.</p><p>While the introduction of UPC labels ignited the ability for the production and sale of products to become more streamlined and accurate, the UPC label has its limitations. Today’s challenging world of manufacturing offers many more efficient and durable options, but utilizing those options has become an industry in itself.</p><p>One of the most notable advancements in manufacturing workflow and efficiency has been Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Though originally designed only for the manufacturing process,&nbsp; ERP systems today integrate everything from the front office to the warehouse. ERP is the wave of the future, and cloud ERP solutions are consistently leading the way in cost reduction and efficiency.</p><p>But even when ERP systems utilize high-quality, data-rich barcodes that house vital inventory and workflow information, companies still need a way to scan, track, and manage that information.&nbsp;<strong>For many operations, thousands of scans are happening on a daily—if not hourly—basis.</strong> Scanning all those different barcodes quickly and correctly, even when the barcodes are damaged, reflective, or warped, is a big undertaking that has the potential to slow down productivity. That’s why Code has developed quality scanning solutions that you can trust to transfer all the correct information into your ERP system without any hiccups.</p><h2><strong>Code Solutions</strong></h2><p><strong>Code has spent years relentlessly researching, developing, and producing highly-durable scanning solutions powered by the industries most aggressive decoding algorithm</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/manufacturing/">for the needs of your manufacturing operation.&nbsp;</a> With Code’s versatile solutions that won’t break the bank, it’s easy to understand why Code is a recommended choice for those in the automotive, aerospace, semiconductor, electronic assembly, and other industries. <strong>We’re confident you will find a superior solution in our line of manufacturing-dedicated scanners.</strong></p><h2><strong>Go Wireless</strong></h2><p>If you need a wireless scanning solution, our Bluetooth-enabled <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-2600/">CR2600 XHD</a> is built to scan the first time (every time) while still being able to withstand the gambit of harsh conditions your facility throws at it. And with the capacity to scan up to 50,000 times on a single charged battery, <i>you’ll likely need a break before it does.</i></p><p>Dropped your scanner on a concrete floor? Dropped it again? And again? No sweat. Our products can survive multiple drops to concrete. Our high-quality plastic housings are also sealed to protect the inner components from particles and harsh cleaning chemicals.</p><h2><strong>Tethered Power</strong></h2><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/677ee19a74a203d18ae4c7cc7d54d0349742af7f/68747470733a2f2f7777772e636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031392f30392f43523935302d66726f6e74322d323035783330302e706e67" alt=""></figure><p>When you don’t want to worry about a scanner “running away,” we have a robust line of tethered options, which includes the <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-1100/">CR1100 XHD</a>, <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-1500/">CR1500 IND</a>, and <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-6000/">CR6000 DPM</a>.</p><p>The CR1000 XHD and CR1500 IND come ready to scan whatever you throw at them with their high-density fields and built-in macro lenses. In short, that means&nbsp;<i>you can scan tiny barcodes with laser precision.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Got a wide array of barcodes that require different illumination? The CR6000 DPM intuitively identifies the correct illumination for reading your label and makes the adjustment automatically. You’ll never need to manually find or select the correct illumination.</p><h2><strong>Product Use Examples</strong></h2><p>Below are some of the most common examples of how Code surpasses the competition and will improve your workflow efficiency.</p><h2><strong>Work-in-Process and Supply Chain Management</strong></h2><p>In many cases, the most vulnerable parts of an operation are within the realms of work-in-process and supply chain management. Incorrect data entry can cause unnecessary delays in your supply chain, and the efficiency of your entire operation can get bogged down if you don’t have up-to-date information on materials as they flow through the production process.</p><p>When integrated into your ERP or work-in-process application, Code barcode solutions can provide a transparent overview of every step. Not only will your production run smoother, but Code can implement automatic inventory management solutions so you can manage inventory without worrying about stock levels or initiating reorders.</p><h2><strong>Dot Peen and Beyond</strong></h2><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2113e2bdc303e90717e6591f0fe4a1b96c853dbb/68747470733a2f2f7777772e636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30352f646f742d7065656e2d333030783231352e706e67" alt="dot peen"></figure><p>Do you or your suppliers or clients use intricate laser-etched or dot peen codes? Do you also need to scan incoming and outgoing shipments? Code scanners are built specifically to handle the vast array of barcodes used in every aspect of the manufacturing industry.</p><p>Do your barcodes occasionally come into your facility damaged or warped? That’s not a problem. Code can scan them.&nbsp;<strong>Code readers scan and decode any type of barcode (over 42 different types) with unique image-based decoding algorithms with our CortexDecoder software that compensate for less than ideal conditions and environments.</strong>&nbsp;Pretty impressive to watch the speed and accuracy first hand! Below are a few of the more common types of barcodes found in the manufacturing industry that our scanners decode with lightning speed:</p><ul><li>1D (ex. retail barcodes)</li><li>2D (ex. data matrix/QR codes)</li><li>Postal</li><li>Color</li><li>Low-contrast</li><li>Laser-etched</li><li>High-density</li><li>Dot peen</li></ul><h2><strong>Track and Trace</strong></h2><p>Does your production process span multiple locations or even operate worldwide? When you are shipping and receiving items from one location to another, it’s essential to have a quick and easy solution for facility workers to be able to scan, track, and trace shipments as they happen. The unmatched scan engine inside all of Code’s DPM barcodes makes it easy to keep a clean and current record of all inventory no matter where it is located.</p><h2><strong>Product Verification</strong></h2><p>Running an efficient operation usually involves some level of product verification. There is a vast array of barcode options that you can use for your product verification purposes. Code scanners feature multiple illumination fields that will intuitively select the field that will read your barcode type most efficiently. So no matter what type of label or coding system you use, you’ll never have to pause to find or select the correct illumination. Your verification process will speed up as a result, saving you time and money.</p><h2><strong>Mobile Application</strong></h2><p>In addition to Bluetooth and tethered scanning options, Code also offers a software-based scanning solution through its software brand CortexDecoder.&nbsp;The same enterprise-grade scanning and decoding power embedded in our hardware scanners in now packaged together in a SDK and available for mobile and embedded application integration. Two SDK options are available CortexDecoder Mobile Enterprise for consumer mobile devices based applications and CortexDecoder Embedded OEM for more OEM applications.&nbsp; These SDKs can turn your teams smartphones into enterprise-grade barcode scanning devices with all the same function and scanning ability dedicated scanning hardware offers. Now, when you’re away from the office, you can still scan a wide variety of barcodes using only your smartphone camera, instantly transferring&nbsp;that information into your ERP system or supply chain management application.</p><h2><strong>Shipping and Delivery</strong></h2><p>No product is worth anything until it arrives at the client’s door, and the barcodes are always in the most perfect condition right? Code scanners again can come to the rescue with the ability to compensate for damage and are built to scan a long list of symbologies including postal barcodes. You can also utilize our scan-to-print functionality to scan and print labels for your shipping needs.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Code scanners work seamlessly with your shipping operation to monitor delivery schedules and aid in delivering shipments on time to the correct locations.&nbsp;</i></p><h2><strong>Specialty Application</strong></h2><p>Have a problem you don’t see a solution for?

In its supporting yet vital role, barcode scanning has the ability to make healthcare’s leading performance even better. How, you might ask? By reducing, if not eliminating, adverse drug events (ADEs), increasing patient safety, and eliminating transcription errors. Government mandates have made data capture solutions a necessary part of healthcare facility operations. Aside from regulations, data capture solutions ensure patient safety through iterative checks and documentation. Unique identifiers (barcodes) are attached to patient wrist bands, medications, equipment, and pretty much every item located in a healthcare setting for track and trace purposes. Additionally, cleaning, inventory, and hospitality crews use data capture solutions to track room cleanings and patient nutrition. Those little barcodes have a very big job.</p><h4><strong>So what’s the point and why does it matter?</strong></h4><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0fab22333f7bf2fe8237497258c82ca05d224906/68747470733a2f2f7777772e636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30342f6d65647363616e2d322e6a7067" alt="medscan 2"></figure><h4><strong>It matters because each workflow may require various types of barcode scanners to keep things running efficiently, and despite what you may have been told,&nbsp;not all barcode scanners are created equal.</strong></h4><p>Barcode scanners used for hospitals with inpatient bedside medication administration or emergency departments, for example, are scrutinized by infection control teams due to the proximity of the scanner to patients. Thus, these workflows require a completely sealed barcode scanner that can hold up to the constant cleaning and sanitizing throughout each shift. In contrast, inventory crews don’t necessitate the same sterilization standards but may need to handle multiple barcodes at high speeds all at the same time. Despite the obvious differences in these workflows, there are still three types of barcode scanners that can easily handle both of their tasks:</p><ol><li><strong>Tethered</strong> (attached to a PC)</li><li><strong>Bluetooth</strong> (wireless connectivity) or</li><li><strong>Mobile units</strong> (cell phones or tablets)</li></ol><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/658784b6f4dbf823eb58fa2e8cc38a61c02c62dd/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f494d475f303632332e6a7067" alt="Code Reader CR2600"></figure><p>Tethered<strong> </strong>units are predominantly used in clinical workflows, like outpatient doctors’ offices, pharmacies, and such. Generally, tethered units are more budget-friendly options, but their cords tend to get in the way when used in an inpatient setting.</p><p>Inpatient environments are more complex. With the IVs and the many cords connected to monitoring equipment, barriers can make access to scanning patient wrist bands and medications like a strange game of Twister™. <strong>Bluetooth</strong>&nbsp;technologies have the competitive advantage here; a small, cordless form factor allows clinicians to freely move around a room and maneuver around a patient. Bluetooth barcode scanners offer clinicians freedom and increase patient interaction and satisfaction.</p><p>The disadvantage to Bluetooth scanners is that they’re dependent upon a connection to a computer. Enter <strong>mobility</strong> products. They are the scanner and computer in one device. They can be used in the same fashion as Bluetooth units but don’t require a PC connection. Mobility scanners run mobile versions of the EHR software application, and several of the mobile EHR applications have built-in barcode reading. Perfect, right? So why doesn’t everyone have one of these you might be asking yourself?</p><h4><strong>Product-to-environment matching is key when choosing a barcode reader.</strong></h4><p>Code Corporation has developed products to meet each of the three stated scenarios. <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-1500/">The CR1500 tethered scanner is the </a>industry-leading<a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-1500/"> product for clinical workflows. </a>With its disinfectant-ready, IP54 rated housing and small form factor, clinicians can easily handle this scanner all day and rely on its performance.

Code’s industry innovating product portfolio includes both hardware and software image-based data capture solutions that spotlight its unique bundle of powerful decoding algorithms. Picking the right data capture technology for your retail barcode scanning needs eliminates many of the workflow efficiency struggles that seem to devour time and resources.</p><h2><strong>Barcodes in Retail</strong></h2><p>Barcodes were literally invented to make the retail industry more efficient. However, the first UPC label showed up much later than you might imagine. It wasn’t until the 70\'s that the first item (a pack of gum) was marked with a barcode and scanned for a customer to purchase. In the last 40 years, technology has come a long way in improving how barcodes help retail businesses. Today there are solutions all across the board to help your retail business run smoothly, but none offer the same level of affordability and reliability as the solutions Code has created.</p><h2><strong>Code\'s Data Capture Solutions</strong></h2><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/506/retail_scanner_1_300x450.jpg"></figure><p>Code has spent years relentlessly researching, developing, and producing cost-effective scanning solutions that not only stand up to the wear and tear of consistent use in the retail industry, but offer technology options that significantly lighten the load accurately decoding even damaged barcodes!

This technological age can be inspiring and overwhelming. The number of "smart" devices that seem to connect themselves has created the perception that barcode scanners are plug-and-play. While this may be true in some situations, like the simplicity of reading a UPC barcode at a store; however, for the majority of workflow scenarios needing data captured to do more than display a price? Those are not as simple. For example, 2D barcodes, tiny or extremely large barcodes, damaged or poor contrasting barcodes, scanning hundreds of barcodes at a single time, or trying to scan something that may have many different types of barcode symbologies all together is far more complicated.</p><p><strong>Specific coding and superior scanning technology make it possible for the barcode scanner to decode these more complicated examples as well as parse only the data wanted from each of the different codes.</strong> This unique ability weeds out most barcode scanners on the market. When you think of the time it can save you, it\'s worth doing your homework. Instead of having to scan one code at a time while covering up others to get the right read, you could scan them all at the same time and only get&nbsp;the data you want. <strong>Genius, right?</strong> Options like this not only save you time and money, they are custom configured and require working with a barcode scanning company that loves to delight their customers with this type of service.</p><p>Our daily lives are controlled by data. When we don\'t get the right data we request, everything comes to a screeching halt. When a barcode fails to scan or delivers a misread, the same is true. Everything stops. We have all been in "that line" at the store, when the barcode won\'t read and the repeated typing in of the number doesn\'t work. Over the intercom we hear, "Manager to register 10." The right barcode scanner makes reading damaged, reflective, or curved barcodes effortless. <strong>The right barcode scanners simply start with the most exceptional intellectual property powering every scan.</strong></p><p>Now that you know a little bit about the complexity in capturing the barcode data you need, what about getting that barcode information into the application or program you need to get your job done? Look at healthcare applications, for example. Sensitive patient data is captured, translated into an appropriate format in the background, and transferred into the hospital Healthcare Information System (HIS) application.</p><p>For this workflow and others, the&nbsp;<strong>data translation is the most critical step</strong>&nbsp;and generally the reason for misreads and errors. <strong>Barcode scanners are only as good as the decoding software that powers them–and not all decoding software is created equal.</strong> Without getting too techy, translation takes the scanned data, modifies it appropriately for cross-platform communication, and populates the appropriate fields within whichever program you\'re using. If the translation decoding is not done properly, the entire thing fails. As a result, most users generally blame the scanner when data capture issues arise; however, <strong>the glitch usually resides with the data translation, not the scanner.</strong> Starting with the best scanning software first, then deciding on a reader, can make everyone\'s day just a little bit brighter (and the checkout line manager happier).</p><p>Most barcode manufacturers offer different product lines that tailor to specific industries with various special features. In fact, they&nbsp; all look similar and are priced very close to the same. No matter the special features or big words, the device will only be as good as the brain that powers it (and we don\'t mean yours). There is a difference in barcode scanners and barcode scanning companies, it\'s the foundation, the decoding algorithms and firmware, that need a closer evaluation as well as the company\'s willingness to create a coded configuration solution that works for you.</p><p><a href="http://services.codecorp.com/">Code Complete</a> was built upon the idea of making it easier for customers to use our barcode scanners.

One of the first items on their list was to find the most efficient mobile solution to improve the varied prescribed medication process with accurate patient identification at the point of care. Shedding bulky sleds and additional scanning hardware, Rush incorporated enterprise-grade barcode scanning mobility, the first of its kind in healthcare, into their workflow using nurse favored and requested iOS devices.</p><h4><strong>Mobility Meets Scanning Muscle</strong></h4><p>It is not surprising that barcode scanning has become one of the most important tools affording the largest advantage for patients within the healthcare industry. In a study titled <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911988/">“Effect of the Implementation of Barcode Technology and an Electronic Medication Administration Record on Adverse Drug Events”,</a> it was found that the implementation of eMAR and Barcode Medication Administration (BCMA) technology improved patient safety by decreasing the overall rate of adverse drug events (ADEs) and the rate of transcription errors. These technologies also reduced the harmful impact to patients caused by administration errors.&nbsp;1</p><p>The daily rounds workflow is as varied and unique as the patients themselves. Finding ways to make the complicated processes easier and more intuitive had Rush administrators pointing to their own mobile devices. Nurses are constantly on-the-go and barcode scanning is a major part of patient care, in fact a critical element in catching and preventing medication errors as well as possible ADEs. For Rush, the preferred solution would be one that was naturally intuitive and &nbsp;could easily travel with them from patient room to room simply fitting in a small pocket–just like a cell phone. It would be light weight, smaller in size, and more accurate with zero-miss barcode reading capabilities.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/45b97a09c66af457e2e79b774866cb7d0661d110/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f45504943524f5645523230636f70792e6a7067" alt="CortexDecoder for Epic Rover"></figure><p>To find their perfect solution, Rush turned to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/epic-rover/id583359867?mt=8">Epic’s iOS mobile application, Rover®,</a>&nbsp;integrated with Code’s® enterprise-grade barcode scanning software. This pair connect in real-time to Epic’s core system to facilitate patient lists, charting, and med administration straight from an iPhone®, or any iOS device running the Rover app. The addition of Code’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codecorp.com/software/">barcode scanning software, CortexDecoder®,</a>&nbsp;now delivers an unparalleled barcode scanning experience using the device’s powerful built-in camera . Armed with Rover and CortexDecoder, Rush found the best mobile solution. Determined to define the most ideal mobile workflow, Rush is setting the precedent for mobility in healthcare.</p><h4><strong>Bye-Bye, Bulky Sled</strong></h4><p>Currently, the de facto mobile barcode scanning solution in healthcare falls to the&nbsp;<i>sled</i>. A sled is generally any rugged case with a built-in barcode scanning engine that a hospital’s mobile device would live inside. Sleds add weight and bulk, and in many cases diminish the performance of iOS functionality. Items such as voice quality and radio bandwidth are big concerns, and sleds struggle to keep up with the turnover in compatibility with the latest versions of iOS devices.</p><p>For Rush, as with most hospitals, a primary way for nurses and clinicians to communicate with one another is by phone calls during their shifts. The need for high-quality sound is imperative when critical care information needs to be understood and acted upon. To have a sled impede efficiency or create more questions for clarification is a major problem.</p><p>iOS phones and devices upgrade yearly, and most people like the benefits and features the latest technology brings. If a hospital wanted to upgrade to take advantage of the latest tech, there would also be the additional cost burden of sled replacement–if there was even a sled option available. After trying on and test-driving many of the different sleds available for iOS and finding the same hurdles in performance and cost,&nbsp;<strong>Rush knew that if the goal was true mobility with no sacrifice in performance all while trying to cut overall hardware costs they needed an integrated solution in order to utilize Rover to its fullest capabilities,</strong>&nbsp;and they needed to think outside of the sled.</p><h4><strong>Soft-Scanning:&nbsp;Mobile Decoding Software Solution&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Epic Systems had a solution in mind called soft scanning for its HIS software. Epic experimented with integrating barcode scanning into Rover, and when the idea gained serious interest they reached out to the industry innovator in that space, Code. With a long 20-year history of solving data capture issues within complicated healthcare workflows, <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/software/">Code’s barcode scanning software was the perfect soft-scan solution they had been looking for to enable Rover the with the zero-miss scanning power it was missing.</a></p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e3523980d1f80bb69a33a9b1694c264b7059b2c0/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f626172636f64652d69636f6e732d30322e706e67" alt="barcode-icons-02"></figure><p>Code’s barcode scanners and the scanning software that powers them, had already made a big name for itself within healthcare, fast becoming a nurse favorite for a few key reasons. Foremost being that the&nbsp;<strong>scanning software powering each barcode scanner outperformed the competition reading barcodes they couldn’t.</strong>&nbsp;After careful testing to ensure superior scan quality, Epic partnered with Code to integrate the first software decoding solution, CortexDecoder, into their Rover application.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f06c498227a05fc12a394cba6f763a4823eb84c3/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f626172636f64652d69636f6e732d30312e706e67" alt="barcode-icons-01"></figure><p>As soon as Rush heard that Code’s soft scanning technology would be a feature offered by Epic in Rover 6.0 for iOS, they knew it was the solution that they had been searching for to deploy their mobility workflow and deliver the superior barcode scanning solution their nurses had been asking for.</p><p>Adding Code’s decoding algorithm to the Rover application turned any iOS device running Rover, into a mobile enterprise-grade barcode scanning solution with zero-miss efficiency. Rush preferred this solution as a way around using a bulky sleds or multiple devices to accomplish the same tasks all while improving scanning capabilities across the board.</p><h4><strong>Sign Me Up–CortexDecoder for Epic Rover</strong></h4><p><strong>Rush was the first health system to pilot and deploy CortexDecoder for Epic Rover.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Epic Developers came to Rush and tested the Rover application and its new scanning feature in many different environments putting Code’s technology to the test. Passing with flying colors, Rush began piloting the Rover application shortly after initial testing in their real workflow environment. According to Rush, piloting took a little over a month and with official deployment of 60 devices took place shortly thereafter.</p><p>Historically, nurses use Rover significantly more than other medical staff.&nbsp; Before the integrated scanning functionality, nurses had to login with a typed full username and password every time they used the application. Naturally this was prone to error entry and multiple attempts to gain access negatively impacting workflow efficiency from the very start. Now, with CortexDecoder a simple scan of their ID badge barcode and a typed 4-digit PIN allows instant access.</p><p>Once inside of the Rover application, a smart list of the nurses’ specific patients appears and the ability to scan patient wristbands and medications to verify and administer is a tap away. Everything scanned by the app is then logged within the application which automatically syncs straight into Epic’s main database, so nothing is missed.</p><p>At Rush, many patient rooms still have a computer workstation with a dedicated barcode scanner. The workstation is primarily used for full medication and patient assessment cycles. Rover has been instrumental for deploying mobile efficiency and accuracy with on-the-fly meds, convenience meds, real time charting, and when the main workstation is in use. When there is a clinician or doctor in the room using the workstation the nurses can still administer medicine and chart using the Rover application.</p><p>Another mobile benefit Rush found using CortexDecoder for Epic Rover was the small screen for night nurses. In the middle of the night when they needed to chart and administer medication they could do so with just the mobile device screen instead of using the big workstation. By not using the large bright workstation screen they were no longer disturbing their sleeping patients.</p><p>Many of the nurses found that the superior scanning power provided by the CortexDecoder software and their iOS device surpassed that of the dedicated workstation barcode readers in regards to small, damaged barcodes or those printed on transparent or shiny surfaces. Workflow efficiency continued to increase when barcodes that were always a problem now scanned with ease.</p><p>“CortexDecoder for Epic Rover’s scanning is reliable, quick and accurate and enables Rush to use the five rights of medication administration: right patient, right medication, right dose, and right route at the right time.

Effective gatekeeping for the privacy, security, and safety of patients and staff requires a form of vendor credentialing. According to Karen Ekstein of Healthcare Purchasing News, “The current healthcare climate has become more complex, sensitive, and political, resulting in a greater concern for patient protection and reduction of business risks (2).”</p><p>An increase in concern for accountability in this digital age compounds the gatekeeping complexity of the healthcare environment. The process of vendor credentialing is an essential solution, helping hospitals capitalize on workflow efficiency while addressing these issues. A trusted partner like Symplr makes it possible.</p><h2><a href="https://www.symplr.com/"><strong>A Symplr Solution Has Arrived.</strong></a></h2><p>Symplr is an industry leader providing easy-to-use software and services which help healthcare organizations meet accreditation and regulatory compliance requirements. They set out to make credentialing the simplest part of an organization’s business processes and have done so with ease. Focusing on vendor and general credentialing, provider management, and payer enrollment services, <a href="https://www.symplr.com/credentialing-services">Symplr has streamlined processes and created a secure system healthcare organizations can rely on.</a></p><h2><strong>How is Vendor Credentialing Done?</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/512/symplrpass_300x388.jpg"></figure><p>Historically, vendor credentialing has been managed in-house by the hospital or healthcare organization staff. Keeping up with changes in requirements, security, and more make the task increasingly more time consuming with a greater fear of items falling through the cracks. For most organizations, this effort becomes an inefficient use of resources. Organizations are finding it more cost-effective and productive to hire a third-party vendor credentialing company such as Symplr. Symplr provides credentialing services on behalf of the hospital or healthcare facilities. This puts&nbsp;hospital resources to better use, increases accountability, and closes security gaps.</p><h2><strong>The Benefits of Having SymplrPass.</strong></h2><p><strong>SymplrPass is Symplr’s solution for quick, accessible vendor credentialing.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;This intuitive, easy to use station requires no internet connection. A revolutionary self-check-in station, Symplr can secure every access point in an entire facility. It scans, screens, and verifies anyone entering the facility. SymplrPass helps protect patients\' safety and reduces risks by ensuring that vendors are fully compliant with the facility policies.</p><p>With SymplrPass, facilities can:</p><ul><li>Boost their credentialing process</li><li>Configure a system to unique facility policies</li><li>Quickly assess vendor compliance</li><li>Satisfy auditing requirements through real-time data logs</li><li>Automate vendor check-in activity alerts</li><li>Manage processes for multi-facility location.</li></ul><h2><strong>How Does SymplrPass Work?</strong></h2><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/513/symplr_check_in_confirmed_300x588-100.jpg"></figure><p>A vendor entering the hospital or healthcare facility is required to have the Symplr smartphone application downloaded.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>On the app, they indicate which hospital or facility they are visiting. The app assigns them a barcode using </strong><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/gocode-secure-barcode/"><strong>GoCode®, Code Corporation’s secure, unique two-dimensional barcode symbology technology.</strong></a> GoCode® is a proprietary symbol and is utilized by companies that have an application that benefits from using a secure barcode. GoCode is a perfect solution for counterfeiting problems or for applications requiring advanced security. GoCode may also be created with user authentication features so critical or sensitive data may only be read by approved and licensed readers.</p><p>After being assigned a barcode by the application, the vendor scans the barcode using the SymplrPass check-in station. <a href="https://info.codecorp.com/blog/healthcare-wins-and-workflow-solutions-include-code-technology"><strong>These check-in stations feature an integrated CR1000 barcode scanner from Code®</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Symplr chose the Code barcode reader selection based on the zero-miss read performance of the scanner as well as the service and support provided by the team at Code. <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-1100/"><strong>The CR1100 reads barcodes directly from a mobile device screen,</strong></a><strong> which is exactly what Symplr looked for during its selection process.</strong></p><p>Once the vendor scans their application at the station and they are verified, a day pass prints from that station giving them access to complete their requested services for the day. This process is repeated each day to ensure facility and personnel changes/requirements are enforced.</p><h2><strong>Accountability That Protects and Reduces Risk!</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vendor credentialing is not only a hot topic of discussion today but an extremely important accountability task for hospitals and healthcare facilities. This single function protects the safety and reduces the overall risk for hospitals, patients and staff. Symplr has created an efficient end-user solution to make vendor credentialing fast, easy, and secure. Code is excited to play a part in this successful mobile data capture solution helping to conserve hospital resources while ensuring a facility is kept safe, secure, and in compliance.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/511/symplr_%26_devices_300x202.jpg"></figure><p><strong>This scan-and-go credentialing technology has the power to maximize resources, optimize processes, ensure accountability and take healthcare securely to that next level of efficiency.</strong></p><p>Sources</p><p>(1)&nbsp; <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/credentialing.html">http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/credentialing.html</a></p><p>(2)&nbsp; <a href="http://www.hpnonline.com/inside/2013-06/VendorCredOverview.pdf">http://www.hpnonline.com/inside/2013-06/VendorCredOverview.pdf</a></p>',

As the cannabis industry continues to grow so do state and federal regulations. From seed to sale, the barcode will be your ticket of compliance and Code, the good-looking wingman that has your back. It is all about doing more, our data capture technology and bundled retail solution packages are designed to keep your business compliant and moving forward. Code\'s extensive line of industry-trusted scanning solutions can immediately replace many of your inefficient processes with a single barcode scanning device. It\'s true. Elevate your customer experience while saving time and money optimizing processes. <strong>Are you ready?</strong></p><h2><strong>A Nation of Regulation</strong></h2><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/515/cannabis_icon.jpg"></figure><p>Though cannabis has not been legalized on the federal level, there are still federally mandated regulations for the growth, production, and sale of all recreational and medicinal cannabis products. Each individual seed must be tracked from grower to end user through every change of hands. That level of transparency keeps the industry in check and protects it not only from becoming a funnel for black market sales but also from losing ground and potentially being scaled back. However, it also makes running a legitimate cannabis business more complicated. Code is here to make navigating the complicated issues of the industry simple and easy.</p><h2><strong>Code Solutions for Cannabis</strong></h2><p>Tracking every step from seed-to-sale can involve multiple businesses in a variety of cities, states, and even countries.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Whether you are in the business of growing, producing, or selling—there is an industry-trusted scanning solution that will fit your every need.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;All of our barcode readers can read dozens of symbologies, so you’ll be ready to scan virtually anything that comes your way. In addition, Code focuses on ensuring optimal scanning efficiency in real-world conditions, not just perfect environments. That means the dirt on your plant tags won’t slow you down!</p><h3><strong>Growers Solution</strong></h3><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/59186d9cd06ce7ba9dd3de57209c417e581920ee/68747470733a2f2f7777772e636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031382f31312f4352323630302d636f64652d626172636f64652d726561646572732d333030783234312e6a7067" alt="CR2600-code-barcode-readers"></figure><p>Growing is the most rugged and dirty part of the seed-to-sale process. Soil is the miraculous medium that nourishes the seed and produces a good plant. However, that same soil can stick to tags and barcodes and make things difficult for scanning and tracking. Time is money. So what happens if the tags don\'t scan...often employees just skip it. Thus putting the whole company at compliance risk. What is the solution? The wireless, <strong>Bluetooth-enabled CR2600</strong> is a durable scanning solution that will read soil-covered, different colored, reflective, damaged, or water-warped barcodes faster than the competition, speeding up your entire tracking process. This lightning-fast scanner is available in a palm or handheld option and features long-lasting, replaceable battery packs and programmable buttons for easy customization. With the right tools, anything is possible!</p><h3><strong>Production Solution</strong></h3><p>If you’re in the business of producing edibles, oils, or other variations of cannabis, Code has wireless mobility scanning solutions that can go wherever you go. <strong>The scanning keyboard wedge, CortexWedge,</strong> was developed to bring enterprise-grade barcode scanning any mobile device your choose. Code\'s scanning technology has been configured and deployed inside an app that is easily downloadable and installed on your mobile device. Once installed you select the field you want the barcode data scanned into, switch your devices keyboard out with the CortexWedge scanning keyboard and click scan. The app then uses the camera on your mobile device to capture the barcode and embedded decoding algorithms to translate the data you need into any input-able form field you choose.&nbsp; Test it out for your self and receive 50 free scans. CortexWedge is a SaaS (Software as a Service) product and will require a license for each device it\'s deployed on.</p><h2><strong>Retail Solution</strong></h2><p>On the retail side, there are even more security and safety elements to consider on top of the government-mandated tracking of cannabis products. For that, you need a solution that will scan purchasing codes, validate coupons or loyalty codes, verify age and IDs, log purchaser information, and keep a firm audit trail of inventory coming in and going out. The CR5000 is the workhorse that will do all that and more! Even the new federally mandated Real ID codes, which use a complex code called PDF417, will scan and log the first time, every time with the CR5000. All that power in one scanner means you’ll never have to worry about an employee misreading the date on an ID or incorrectly logging pertinent information. Looking for that Appleisk mobile retail experience for your customers? Our barcode scanners can connect to your mobile devices or there are software scanning options that can turn your mobile device into the barcode scanner. Checks, double checks, and check out all on a single device. Now you\'re talking!</p><h2><strong>Product Use Examples</strong></h2><p>Below are some of the most common examples of how Code can help you run an efficient and compliant cannabis operation.</p><h3><strong>Point-of-Sale</strong></h3><p>In an industry as tightly regulated as the cannabis industry, the last thing you want to worry about is a sub-par POS system. If your POS system is under-performing or just not built to track and trace the details that the cannabis industry requires of you, Code solutions are here to help. If you need to upgrade your existing system with better hardware, Code scanners come ready to use right out of the box, reducing downtime and lost productivity. If you need to migrate to a new software solution altogether, Code’s team of experts can help you get everything set up and hit the ground running!</p><h3><strong>Inventory Management</strong></h3><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/516/cannabis_oil.jpg"></figure><p>Loss prevention is a point of concern in any industry, but in the cannabis industry, it’s a critical issue that could land you in hot water. When you use Code scanners to track inventory, monitor stock levels, and trace products going out, you can be sure that everything is being accounted for in realtime. Creating an inventory log using Code scanners will also help you maintain a “paper trail” in case your supply chain is ever audited. But the benefits of using Code for inventory management don’t stop there! You can ensure continuous inventory levels with automatic reordering that activates when stock falls below a designated threshold.</p><h3><strong>Strains and Dosing</strong></h3><p>There are countless strains of cannabis on the market and countless more being created and tested in labs. These strains can be used in various forms and doses to treat all kinds of ailments. In a medicinal dispensary, Code can accurately track dispensing and help you monitor the effects of various strains and varieties of cannabis. In the traditional healthcare industry, Code has been trusted for years to monitor and track bedside medication and dosing. When you use Code to track patient care in your medicinal dispensary, you are using a solution that has already been rigorously tried, tested, and approved.</p><h3><strong>Access Controls</strong></h3><p>Whether you’re growing, producing, or selling, there are certainly products and areas to which you will need to restrict access to credentialed persons only. Code’s scanning technology can be used to protect areas large and small with secure access points. Don’t risk losing track of inventory. Make sure you know exactly who is accessing your products and when with Code’s secure access and tracking solutions.</p><h3><strong>Age Verification</strong></h3><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/13ed2b13d16a14d6402311b5fc23d7031a9e6fee/68747470733a2f2f7777772e636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031382f31322f4352353030302d4845524f2d72657461696c2d333030783231332e706e67" alt="CR5000-HERO-retail"></figure><p>Code is serious about protecting the integrity and longevity of your cannabis business. In the world of age verification, any error in scanning state—or government-issued identifications could mean damaged reputation, a large fine, or even loss of business license. Why risk it?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Code offers reliable, fast-reading solutions that make it easy for you to verify and capture age information without error.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;In addition, complying with the law may require you to store time-stamped data.

With so many barcodes to scan on a single blood bag, the process of trying to hide and scan the right ones, in the right order adds just a wee bit of stress. IV bags pose a different problem sporting a single white barcode printed on the bag which is then encased inside of another clear bag adding layers of reflected complication. Is there a solution for scanning complicated barcodes and parsing only correct information needed ignoring the rest? Why, yes there is a solution, it is called Code.</p><p><strong>The healthcare industry has focused on addressing this issue by adopting new processes and technology to combat human error in the labeling of transparent bags.</strong></p><h2><strong>Barcodes, Barcodes, Barcodes</strong></h2><p>Historically, blood transfusion required two nurses to be available for the whole process because of the careful checking of whether the medication or blood matched the patient. Barcodes and reliable readers significantly cut down on the human error but issues still loom. Reading these barcodes is a time consuming and more complicated process. It isn\'t your typical point, scan, beep–next process. Blood bags have so many barcodes the readers light up like a Christmas tree and the nurses are not sure which of the barcodes was read. IV bags might only have a single barcode, but it is printed white and most scanner just can\'t perform the task.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/519/saline_scan_300x300.jpg"></figure><p>Overall barcodes have delivered process improvements for every healthcare workflow and offered valuable checks and balances ensuring patient safety, <strong>nurses just simply need their barcode scanners to work as hard as they do. That means they need the ability to read these very difficult barcodes with near zero-miss efficiency</strong>.</p><p>Barcode scanning technology requires contrast for accurate reads. If the barcode in question doesn’t show enough contrast between its light and dark elements, scanners fail to register any information. Saline bags are the perfect example of this with their white barcodes printed on the transparent material of the bag. It is hard for a lot of basic barcode readers to pick up, plus the added illumination makes the code all but disappear. This would require nurses to devise a creative solution to add a solid color behind the bag while simultaneously trying to scan the barcode. Not very easy or efficient.</p><p>Blood bags have 4, 5, 6, or more barcodes printed on the front label. Each barcode used for a different purpose and serving a specific function. To put it simply, a basic barcode reader just gets confused and will scan the barcode that is the easiest to scan. Often it has trouble focusing on a specific barcode. Nurses find themselves again trying to work around the problem covering up barcodes they didn\'t want to scan, in order to encourage the scanning of the ones they need. Again, not so helpful or efficient right?</p><h2><strong>Code to the Rescue</strong></h2><p>That’s where Code readers come in. With Code, healthcare professionals achieve accurate results the first time every time.&nbsp;Code’s barcode scanning technology ensures that scanners can read omni-directionally and against all types of backgrounds, making colored barcodes, reflection, or contrast issues no longer a problem.&nbsp;Code barcode scanners will read the white barcodes on saline bags on the first try (mic drop).</p><p>Code healthcare scanners are customizable to read every barcode on a blood bag at once, blocking data from the codes your team doesn’t need. This custom blood bag scanning module is also available for your mobile workflow. If your mobile HIS has integrated Code\'s CortexDecoder software-based barcode scanning then you\'re all set!

As anyone who has stayed in a hospital well knows, nurses and doctors perform checks, dispense medication, and prescribe treatments at all hours of the day or night. This hectic schedule means that medical specialists need a reliable way to keep track of the constantly changing needs of patients—including medication administration. <strong>Bedside point of care—the process healthcare workers use to organize and dispense medications—is an integral part of any hospital stay.</strong> With Code’s line of patented scanning solutions for the healthcare industry we make just about every aspect of the job easier. From patient safety, comfort, and care–a Code scanning solution is there to help monitor and verify.</p><h2><strong>Medication Mistakes and Patient Safety</strong></h2><p>The number one safety issue in the healthcare industry is the failure to properly administer medication to patients. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that more than 700,000 injuries and deaths occur each year partially because of this problem. Prescriptions are tricky and require hospital staff to keep track of several key points. Nurses have to make sure they know which person needs medication, the type of medication to give, the amount, and the timing of doses. If any of this information is wrong or the timing of a dose is delayed, patients may experience unnecessary discomfort or pain. Multiply the complexity of medicating one patient by a dozen and you get a sense of how difficult it can be to attend to the constantly changing needs of every patient. Tracking all of this data correctly and maximizing patient care and comfort is possible with the help of barcode scanners.</p><h2><strong>Efficiency with Barcodes</strong></h2><p>In the pre-digital age, nurses had to physically look up medication information on paper documents, match the information to the patient in question, and then research dosages before administering it. A process that once took an hour has been cut down to mere minutes with barcode readers.</p><p>Code readers use unique barcodes to match medically prescribed drugs with the patients who need them. Using integrated software, Code readers keep track of dosages, medication types, and administration frequency so that the hospital staff doesn’t have to. Real-time updates mean that there is a minimized loss of consistency in patient care through shift changes. Healthcare workers can see exactly when the last dose was given, what it was, and when the next one is due—all at their fingertips.</p><h2><strong>Code is the Answer</strong></h2><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/522/cr2700_patient_scan_300x300.jpg"></figure><p>At Code, <strong>we build barcode readers specifically for bedside point of care.</strong></p><p>Our readers are compact, sturdy, and reliable. They can read virtually any barcode used in the healthcare industry including both 1D and 2D barcodes. We use <strong>PVC-free plastic</strong> housings that are disinfectant-ready, which means they are <strong>non-toxic and can survive the harsh chemicals required for sterilizing</strong> medical equipment.</p><p>The components inside the plastic feature glare-reduction technology so that barcodes can be effectively read from any surface, at all hours of the day, and in all types of lighting conditions.

First: can this phone scan and record important information about medications, IV fluids, or patient data? Second: can it be sterilized for use in areas with critical care patients? Third: do you depend on your phone as an extension of the quality care you provide? Finally: does the battery on the phone need to last a full 12-hour shift, all while protecting and extending the life and integrity of your phone? If you answered yes to these criteria, then <strong>your phone isn’t really a phone, it’s a piece of medical equipment and your case has to do more than simply hold that phone.</strong></p><h2><strong>Protecting Patients &amp; Your Mobile Investment Is Completely Possible</strong></h2><p>Today, many hospitals and clinics rely on the iPhone® as a vital addition to their mobile point-of-care workflows, but phones by themselves are inherently unsanitary and can’t withstand the rigorous cleaning and disinfecting required in healthcare environments. To protect the phone, and the patients, many healthcare professionals use commercial cases. Unfortunately, these come with a variety of risks and issues. For example, most (if not all) commercial cases are made of materials such as polycarbonate plastic, PVC, or rubber. While these materials are excellent for protecting a phone from a damaging fall, subjecting them to disinfectants or sterilants&nbsp; quickly results in the degradation of materials and increases patient risk.</p><p>Mobile equipment battery power also concerns medical professional. Long shifts, late nights, and busy floors run a battery down quickly. Each mobile device has a limited number of charge cycles before the battery on that device stops holding a full charge. We have all seen first-hand, the more you use a phone the faster the battery runs down and the more often it needs charging. According to a report from Kingsley-Hughes, Apple says the <strong>iPhone battery is "designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles.</strong>" (<a href="https://tek.io/2XH9zFL">https://tek.io/2XH9zFL</a>) Logic dictates a busy healthcare mobile workflow would devour the useful life of a phone in a few short months. Having the ability to quickly add life to a phone is more than just a convenience. <strong>Keeping the phone running without using a single charge cycle? we call that genius!</strong> (Keep reading, you will understand what we mean.)</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6a2b6400221f0b5c0b75022ffabe057ca99e7332/68747470733a2f2f7777772e636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f4352373031382d6375742d6f75742d6261636b2d7765622e706e67" alt="CR7018 cut out back web"></figure><p>While some commercial products offer extra battery life, most only provide an additional hour or two to the battery inside the phone. Putting your phone down for charging means loss of productivity that just isn’t acceptable in the fast-paced world of healthcare, and opening a case to change a battery means a time-eating case swap, or the risk of contamination which also rates as a “fail.” In a recent study, typical phones were found to have about 17,000 germs and bacteria on them. <strong>Among the most distressing finds were Streptococcus, MRSA, and E. coli.</strong> (<a href="https://time.com/4908654/cell-phone-bacteria/">https://time.com/4908654/cell-phone-bacteria/</a>). It stands to reason that these same pathogens exist on both the phone and the case. Phones are just not designed to withstand the harsh healthcare-grade disinfectants needed to keep patients safe. Without having a completely sealed case, germs are free to hitch a ride, or a phone must be subjected to disinfectants that can cause chemical corrosion.</p><p>A commercial case may offer good protection in case a phone gets bumped or dropped, but even with “shatter-proof glass,” the risk of a broken screen remains high. Phone and case manufacturers continue to find stronger, more durable materials, but most can’t withstand the daily rigors of a healthcare facility. Their <strong>lighter weight and less durable materials result in fractured screens, broken glass, worn-out connections, and degradation of ports for frequent charging</strong> because batteries can’t survive the long-use periods.</p><h2><strong>Commercial Cases Don\'t Hold Up to Healthcare Punishment – Unless They\'re Code!</strong></h2><p>In short – commercial cases can’t hold up to the punishment exacted on them by typical use cases in hospitals, clinics, and urgent care centers. So how do you offer the mobility freedom healthcare teams desire and protect the large investment in mobile technology&nbsp; hospitals must make facing the expensive reality of a shortened product life span from excessive use and chemical cleanings? The answer is simple: the <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-7018/">Code CR7018 battery backup case, </a>designed specifically for the needs of the healthcare community. It not only meets the demands of hard-working healthcare professionals, but it holds up to the daily use and cleaning required of a <strong>legitimate piece of medical equipment.</strong></p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1a122a9de18688bca53d0259f8ba819e0d0cef78/68747470733a2f2f7777772e636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f4352373031382d436c65616e696e672d50686f746f2d574542534954452d50524f445543542d504147452d333030783231372e6a7067" alt="CR7018 Cleaning Photo WEBSITE PRODUCT PAGE"></figure><p>The CR7018 completely encloses the iPhone® 7 or 8&nbsp; and uses IP54 barriers so there is<strong> no risk of bacteria or other material getting inside to the phone</strong>. Made of PVC-free CodeShield® level 3 medical grade plastic it’s both durable and disinfectant-ready. It features Dragontrail™ Glass that is both shatter- and scratch-resistant and won’t cloud or fog as a result of cleaners and disinfectants. The case also offers a 2700 mAh lithium-ion external battery. No plugging in, no changing cases, and no risk of contamination when you need to change the battery. <strong>The risks posed by any potential pathogens carried on either the phone or the commercial case are mitigated because the phone is sealed within</strong> the CR7018 which can be completely wiped down.</p><h2><strong>What About That Genius Part?</strong></h2><p>When an iPhone® 7 or 8 is placed inside the CR7018, <strong>the phone immediately begins using power from the external battery in the case rather than the internal phone battery</strong>. Notifications can be set to remind you when the external battery reaches a certain percentage to swap it out with a new one. Since the phone uses external battery power (here is that genius part again), <strong>you are not using the regular phone charge cycles</strong>. This protects the longevity of both the phone and its internal battery, extending the life of both, which becomes a significant cost savings to the facility. Additionally, BatteryTrak, a mobile app designed for the CR7018 feeds real-time vitals of your battery and deployed statistics so <strong>you and your IT team have access to vital performance information</strong>. Five-bay or ten-bay battery charging stations can be mounted vertically or horizontally to fit the needs and available space of your work area.</p><p>Yet another added benefit of the CR7018 is its <strong>ability to facilitate accurate barcode scanning.</strong> Code’s zero-miss decoding software, CortexDecoder®, can be easily integrated into your healthcare application or found currently integrated within Epic Rover. Your facility can reduce medication errors and the need for additional scanning hardware with this amazing software-based scanning solution. Because Dragontrail™ glass doesn’t fog or cloud with repeated cleaning and sterilization, you can be certain <strong>you’ll have top performance from your phone and case for much longer than any commercial case.</strong></p><h2><strong>Does the Code CR7000 Series Have Any Criticism?</strong></h2><p>The CR7018 is <i>ever so slightly larger</i> than other commercial cases, and a few clinicians have commented about the additional weight. Here’s an interesting fun fact: the CR7018 is purpose built for healthcare workflows and qualifies as medical equipment. It may be bigger than the case you have been using, but chances are your other case doesn’t qualify as medical equipment. It doesn’t use medical grade materials, it doesn’t offer guaranteed full enclosure of your phone, it doesn’t feature an external hot-swap battery allowing the phone to run on external power-saving its own charge cycles, and it can’t stand up to the disinfectants and sterilants required in your facility. You’re going to replace that case three or more times in a year while the CR7018 is still hard at work.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/healthcare-datacapture/#demo">Test it out for yourself and schedule a no-risk demo today!</a></p><p>More importantly, if your ultimate concern is the health and well-being of your patients, why wouldn’t you choose the case that ensures your patients’ safety while still being able to perform your duties with maximum efficiency? <strong>The choice should be clear</strong>, but if you have any questions, give us a call!

Many of these are caused by strong bacteria that can lead to serious complications like sepsis, or even death1. Mobile technology at the point of care has historically been unable to stand up to strict cleaning and disinfecting processes. This meant devices would get damaged under chemical exposure, or worse, they weren’t being cleaned properly, contributing to the spread of infectious disease. The CR7018 solves this problem by protecting the mobile devices from damage while promoting easy, thorough disinfection.</p><p>“The CR7000 allows healthcare leaders to protect their investments but more importantly their patients,” said Jennifer Braun, Mobile Program Manager. “Healthcare facilities have been searching for an enterprise mobility solution that accommodates their workflows and meets infection control standards—they’re looking for the CR7000 product line.”</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d8269a4e9fc4fa605df0778f2f861cebadf4b978/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f4352373031382d6375742d6f75742d6261636b2d7765622e706e67" alt="CR7018-cut-out-back-web"></figure><p>Over the past few years, hospitals have been making do with consumer grade cases to protect and provide power for their iPhones. Unfortunately, these cases do not fully enclose the phone, leading to difficult infection control and premature failure of the mobile devices do to chemical exposure. These consumer cases also don’t have a swappable battery option. In order to keep the phone charged and working hospitals must swap the entire cases for a charged one, as a result creating an increase in phone damage from drop and premature failure of the cases as a whole.</p><p>The CR7000 mobile series is designed explicitly for clinical workflows. The CodeShield plastics and Dragontrail™ glass screen protector provides confidence and durability; the fully enclosed housing safeguards against potentially harmful biomatter buildup; the quick-swap batteries and charging solutions provide 24/7 power and flexibility to keep your clinicians on the go; the BatteryTrak™ mobile application gives administrators visibility to the age of their batteries and helps them plan appropriately for replacements. <strong>There is no other mobile solution built specifically for clinicians like the CR7000</strong>.

Every year, communities across the US mourn the loss of the upstanding men and women who serve in public safety roles. A great number of these deaths directly result from accidents that occur as part of a routine traffic stop.</p><p>According to research by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), law enforcement officers are four times more likely to be involved in a traffic collision than the average civilian motorist. In the years between 2000 and 2009, fully 60% of all officer deaths resulted from traffic-related incidents. Of officers who died as a result of a traffic incident, 42% involved the officer being struck on the side of the road. (<a href="https://www.policechiefmagazine.org/preventing-traffic-related-line-of-duty-deaths/">https://www.policechiefmagazine.org/preventing-traffic-related-line-of-duty-deaths/</a>)</p><h2><strong>Keeping Those Safe Who Keep Us Safe</strong></h2><p>With these sobering statistics at the forefront of the minds of police officials, programs have been initiated to help keep officers safe and to make drivers more aware of the risks officers face. Driver education constitutes a big part of this approach; making drivers aware of the need to slow down, mover over, and look for an officer out of the police vehicle if drivers see one to the side of the road. They also endeavored to make both vehicles and officers more visible to drivers using things such as reflective markings and clothing, improved emergency lighting, and safety vests to ensure officers are obvious at a scene. Officer education played a role as well. Officers began receiving training in safer methods for approaching traffic stops, better vehicle positioning, and more effective assessment of scenes.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1fef6f382428344aad5e9ca50cbcac537629055a/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f436f64652d72657365617263682d73686f77732d4c61772d456e666f7263656d656e742e706e67" alt="Code-research-shows-Law-Enforcement"></figure><p>But law enforcement officials felt that more could be done to help officers responding to traffic incidents. The advent of automated technology that is portable and accessible to officers could help to further reduce the risks. Using barcode scanning, responding officers can scan drivers license information and reduce the amount of time needed to issue a citation, check the validity of the identification, and even scan insurance information. As compared to issuing a paper citation, using the automated system takes only a fourth of the time. Information from the license automatically populates the required fields on the citation form and sent electronically or printed in the officer’s vehicle. Less time stopped at the side of the road equals a reduced risk for the officer.</p><h3><strong>Data Capture Technology as a Safety Solution</strong></h3><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4afd85132a49c86351bf32496ba6c2afd5bc521f/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f494d475f303436322e6a7067" alt="IMG_0462"></figure><p>Code offers a number of barcode readers that feature driver license data parsing, omnidirectional reading, and easy integration with all law enforcement software systems for faster, more reliable data capture. For states that have adopted digital ID’s, Code’s scanning technology also easily captures and decodes ID information from mobile devices even if the screens are cracked or damaged. Code scanners are lightweight and durable, holding up to the rigors and unexpected challenges from the daily law enforcement ride-along.</p><p>You can learn more about our <a href="https://www.codecorp.com/other/">public safety-suitable options here</a>.&nbsp; Let us show you how Code barcode scanning can help improve the safety of your officers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

For example:</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/aea8305547f3b9f14844a3387d74244a4325e6ea/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f696d6167652d392e706e67" alt=""></figure><ul><li>Can smartphones scan fast enough?</li><li>Are smartphones capable of operating barcode scanner SDKs like traditional or dedicated scanners?</li><li>Are mobile scanners as accurate as dedicated scanners?</li><li>Is using a smartphone secure?</li></ul><h2><strong>The Short Answer to These Questions is Yes!</strong></h2><p>For the long answer, keep reading.</p><p>If you want to switch to mobile scanning devices, the possibilities are endless. There is a wide range of devices available with high-powered cameras, intuitive user interfaces, and more than enough processing power. This means it’s easy to find a perfect solution for you.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/26332708866b715d5fe38fac4cae0beb83d25dc7/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f315f73796d706c72312d476f436f64652e706e67" alt=""></figure><p>Plenty of scanner SDKs will integrate into most mobile applications and match the same scanning speed as traditional barcode scanners. Some even that do it better! CortexDecoder® barcode scanner SDK integrates into most mobile platforms, but its decoding algorithm works great with the majority of smartphone processors.</p><h2><strong>How Will You Scan?</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To understand the possibilities of using a smartphone as a barcode scanner, consider this common issue: you need to scan a bunch of products quickly. Using a traditional scanner, you would scan each product one by one. With a smartphone, you open the app and scan an entire block of products all at once instead of individually. This saves a lot of time and improves efficiency and productivity. By expediting your workflows, you also cut down on errors.</p><p>Due to the revolution in technology, barcode scanners have become an everyday piece of equipment. Businesses cannot be as productive without using barcode technology for inventory management, shipping and receiving, and warehouse management. In the current business landscape, mobile barcode scanning applications are a critical trend that saves both time and money.</p><h2><strong>Why You Should Consider Adopting a Mobile Scanning Solution</strong></h2><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/53aaacbdbf4e59fee148b68976d265df4e14167d/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f626c6f622e6a7067" alt="Image result for tablet scanner"></figure><h4><strong>Saves Time:</strong></h4><p>Think back to the early methods of managing inventory. That clunky process involved lots of physical manpower collecting and storing product information one item at a time. The margin for error was huge and the costs in time, wages, and lost productivity were high. With barcode technology, all that work can be done with a fraction of the manpower. Instead of having to log everything on a notebook by hand and then transferring to an automated system, a simple scan can decode all the information and store it in a digital inventory management system. Using mobile barcode scanning applications makes that process even easier with multi-capture functionality that allows you to instantly scan a group of products, record the associated data, and move to the next. This saves time and lets you focus on more productive tasks.</p><h4><strong>Increases Efficiency:</strong></h4><p>Humans aren’t perfect. Mistakes happen when you have to manage multiple tasks at the same time. Additionally, accessing historical data on specific items in inventory can be a challenge if that information was misfiled or buried under a pile of papers. With barcode scanning, you can identify in a matter of seconds which products you have, how many, and where they are located. Moreover, with mobile barcode scanning applications, you simply take your phone out of your pocket, open the app, scan the product, and check the history to find what you need. This not only saves time but increases efficiency and productivity.</p><h4><strong>Improves Internal Operations:</strong></h4><p>You likely have a continual system of internal checks and balances to make sure that your employees follow the rules. Tracking assets, man-hours of each employee, and myriad other internal data can be expensive and time-consuming to manage. Using a mobile barcode scanning application consolidates all of that information into one system, making it more convenient to track and manage every part of your internal operations. When your internal operations run smoothly,&nbsp; your business runs more smoothly externally as well.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/325b35b115d8daeebec3c4c053fbf2580ced19b8/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f696d6167652d31302e706e67" alt=""></figure><h4><strong>Eliminates Bulky Equipment:</strong></h4><p>Smartphones fit inside your pocket because of their ergonomic design. Using a mobile application is a lot easier and more comfortable than carrying around a heavy device slung over your shoulder or strapped to your belt.</p><h4><strong>Turns Any Smart Device Into A Barcode Scanner:</strong></h4><p>There’s no need to invest in additional, expensive scanning technology when any device can be transformed into a barcode scanning device—including your employees’ own devices.</p><h4><strong>Reduces Technology Repair Costs:&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Traditional scanning devices can be damaged over time or break down as they age. Using a mobile application helps you save on repair and the cost of replacing old devices. It’s far easier and less expensive to update software than to replace hardware.</p><h4><strong>Ensures Compatibility With Existing Software:</strong></h4><p>When you use the mobile barcode scanner SDK for your business, you can simply purchase or build your own application and customize the compatibility of the software.</p><h4><strong>Utilizes Cloud Security:</strong></h4><p>The ability to save and backup scanned data from your mobile application gives you peace of mind that your most critical data will always be secure and accessible. No more lost papers or misplaced files, no more notes on clipboards or sticky notes.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3fdd3d62e94fa7961545ae9425dee9eaf52b5586/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f335f636f727465782d6465636f6465722d6c6f676f2d636f6c6f722e706e67" alt="cortex-decoder-logo-color"></figure><p>CortexDecoder gives you the peace of mind and confidence to shift your scanning to a mobile system.

The equipment used to diagnose and treat patients has changed radically in just the past 50 years. Doctors now can look at the human body in ways that could previously only be imagined on Star Trek. Every day, medical science brings us closer to curing everything from cancer to the common cold.</p><p>Much of this advancement directly results from a greater understanding of pathogens, contamination, and proper sterilization techniques. Some of these practices have only been around for the last 20 years or so. It seems unbelievable that much of our medical knowledge and healthcare procedures came into practice in the last few decades. Thankfully, we have better sterilization and reduced contamination in hospitals and healthcare facilities now. In order to maintain these gains in quality care, medical facilities have to remain vigilant.&nbsp; Protecting against accidental transfer, contamination, or spreading bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms remains the top priority.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4c0ba13e2e77dbc9a1dc63b4bb7e8d011bbd01b9/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f4352323730302d436c65616e696e673230313230303230783230383433323053616c65732e6a7067" alt="CR2700-Cleaning 1200 x 843 (Sales)"></figure><h2><strong>CDC Guidelines</strong></h2><p>Cleaners and disinfectants remain the most effective tool in the sterilization process. Hospitals, clinics, care centers, and offices rely on these chemical solutions for protecting the safety of staff and patients . Protocols developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/index.html</a>) established standards for ensuring that contamination isn’t spread by people, equipment, instruments, or materials used in medical facilities. These standards are required of every medical facility in the United States. The protocols help keep patients safe and healthy during their visit, regardless of how long it may be.</p><p>However, disinfectants and cleaners are made of harsh chemicals, and some equipment doesn\'t hold up well to even one use. A daily routine and possibly multiple exposures to these compounds can cause degradation. Because of the costs for replacing equipment, some healthcare professionals are tempted (or even encouraged) to minimize sterilization practices. Unfortunately, this increases the risk of cross-contamination. Hospitals have reported a rise in health issues such as Staph infections, MRSA, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E coli,&nbsp;</i>salmonella, and Clostridium sordellii. Increases in hospital-acquired infections (HAI) directly relate to failure to follow CDC protocols. These infections can lead to increased hospital stays, increased medications, possible surgical intervention, or even patient death.</p><h2><strong>Shortcuts Don\'t Help</strong></h2><p>Many hospitals go to extreme lengths to stay compliant with regulations, even disregarding manufacturer suggestions for cleaning equipment. Staff members often take short-cuts, even risking the integrity of the equipment. Soaking smaller implements in the harsh cleaning and disinfecting chemicals tempts many nurses in the fast-paced medical environment. A lot of equipment falls victim to the chemicals meant to help hospitals maintain a safer environment. Cleaners and disinfectants cause degradation to plastic and metal, shortening the lifespan of the equipment and increasing facility costs. Finding a product resistant to the damage caused by disinfectants and cleaners would mean a better bottom line. Let us&nbsp;introduce you to one of those resistant products: the CR2700 is built specifically for the healthcare community and offers a number of features that launch us far ahead of the competition (<a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-2700/">https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/code-reader-2700/</a>). Among the advantages of the CR2700 are:</p><ul><li>Inductive charging, which means no exposed metal.

Barcode scanning has existed for almost 50 years, and its value grows with each passing year. Manufacturing relies on this technology for inventory management, shipping and receiving, traceability, and much more. Without barcodes, employees would be calculating and recording by hand in order to track the various components of the business. Studies prove performing these processes manually leads to more mistakes, costing businesses time and money.</p><h2><strong>Barcodes Make Products Traceable</strong></h2><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/67a76862684a0ea3c09326df5a8e8f3b53dff375/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f345f626c6f622e6a7067" alt="blob"></figure><p>As products move from through the supply chain, companies need the ability to track each piece. Traceability in manufacturing has grown in importance over the past decade, and barcodes help address this concern. Barcoding makes it extremely easy to locate products. With one scan, a barcode reveals the history and information on a product or component. Without barcodes, products remain annonymous.</p><h2><strong>Time is Money, so Speed is Key</strong></h2><p>The growth of e-commerce in the past decade exceeded the projections of most experts. Customers often look online before driving to a brick and mortar location. Frequently, they make their purchase online without ever setting foot inside a business. A significant factor for customers choosing whether or not to buy online is the speed of delivery for their product. Consumers expect to receiving their purchases in a few days’ time. But in order for&nbsp;this happen, manufacturers have to streamline operations and leave no room for error in their systems.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b529dd5d1d83256fc6ed613caec511380ebc3eb3/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f74696d6532306d6f6e65792e706e67" alt="time money"></figure><p>When time matters, speed is the answer. Barcode scanning is exponentially faster than relying on human tabulation for inventory, shipping, or processing. Not only do barcodes speed up manual processes, but they are more accurate as well. No more double counting or missed items, and results can be instantly compared to records to verify information in real time.</p><h2><strong>Saving Time Means Saving Money</strong></h2><p>The average human being makes a mistake every 300 keystrokes. Barcode scanners, however, only make mistakes once in a few million scans. It doesn’t take a mathematician to see the cost benefit provided by adding barcode scanning to your workflows. In addition to saving money by eliminating mistakes, barcodes can help a company increase production. Scanning one barcode may only save a few seconds, but those seconds begin to add up. Warehouses and production facilities run more smoothly saving time and money. Also, this increased efficiency and savings allows for improvements such as increased product lines, expanded service areas, and an improved online presence.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0930a4ce5ac93df220f9a813d94722258dce7452/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f68617070793230656d706c6f796565732e706e67" alt="happy employees"></figure><p>Barcodes don’t just help a company in one or two areas; the effects can be seen throughout an entire company. Investing in a barcode scanning system equals investing in productivity. Employees who feel productive are happier in their jobs. As a consequence, happy employees stay longer at a company, reducing the costs of turn over and training. They also more willingly share positive feedback about the company, encouraging other qualified workers to apply. Additionally, cost savings from barcoding can be used to offset the rising costs of insurance, can be applied toward improving facilities, or can be applied toward bonuses for employees.</p><p>Barcode scanning to improves processes in manufacturing and many companies have taken the leap.

The largest of these ancient warehouses, called the Horrea Galbae, covered more than 225,000 square feet. Evidence showed it stored grain, olive oil, wine, foodstuffs, clothing, and even marble. These early facilities had thick walls, high windows, and ramps instead of stairs to making moving the goods easier. Other than varying in size, warehouses remained similar in their design and purpose for nearly 2,000 years.</p><p>The Industrial Revolution of the 18th&nbsp;and 19th&nbsp;centuries moved the thinking about these buildings away from long-term storage and toward product movement. This shift in focus helped to create some of the earliest large-scale supply chains. The next step forward came in the 20th century. Advancements in production, communication, and transportation led to the creation of warehouse networks all over the world.</p><h2><strong>Automation and Beyond</strong></h2><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5c7ffbb668ba8f4e626052f203fefc2e7b7d8d5f/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f6175746f6d6174696f6e2e706e67" alt="automation"></figure><p>Now, in the 21st century, warehouses are moving toward the next innovation: automation. Machines now handle the heavy lifting of boxes filled with products or shipments of raw materials. Conveyor belts transport products to sorting stations. Automation reigns as the standard of warehouse operation. Only the tracking system remains as the one area stuck in the past within the warehouse.&nbsp;Products arrive at warehouse facilities with one (or more) of dozens of different barcodes. These barcodes help track the source of the product, its destination, and other vital information needed.</p><p>Possibly you have a barcode scanning system in place. For more than 50 years, many companies have found barcode scanning an excellent return on investment over other systems. Many of these systems became outdated, inefficient, and cumbersome as technology advanced. However, your scanner software may not allow for wireless scanning, requiring you to move products to the scanner rather than using a mobile scanner that can move to the product. Another issue with outdated systems is the software. Older software limits in the number of symbologies it can read which means limits in its effectiveness and functionality as well.</p><h2><strong>Toward the Future of Your Warehouse</strong></h2><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2e56bdbaed3658ce19f179d51a0154138ea3edb4/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f77617265686f757365322e706e67" alt="warehouse2"></figure><p>With products arriving from across the country, or possibly around the world,&nbsp; you’ll likely encounter multiple barcode symbologies during an average day. Your software needs to be able to read and interpret each symbology so you collect the most accurate accounting of every item you receive. You also need software that can read those codes under the most challenging circumstances. When the barcode arrives damaged, curled, or incomplete; or when&nbsp; scanning requires high or low angles; or when bright light, low light, or fluctuating light comprise your situation, you need to know that your barcode scanning software provides you accurate results on the first try every time.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4b569f73f600d7df60590e717d929fc6083f3f43/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f325f636f727465782d6465636f6465722d6c6f676f2d636f6c6f722e706e67" alt="cortex-decoder-logo-color"></figure><p>Code invites you to test the CortexDecoder software.

The examples below are just a few of the most common applications for using Code scanners and technology in the healthcare industry.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We have countless more applications, in addition to these examples, where Code scanners will thrive and improve your workflow.</strong></p><h3><strong>Bedside Medication Administration</strong></h3><p>Humans make mistakes – plain and simple. And a lot of humans have pretty poor handwriting. This is where barcodes truly save the day. There is just no room for error when it comes to administering medication to patients—whether it happens due to writing the wrong dosage or just incorrectly reading the dosage.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://info.codecorp.com/blog/bedside-point-of-care">Code scanners work to help reduce medication administration errors </a>by reading and decoding the correct patient information, matching, and verifying with zero-miss accuracy. Matching the right dose of the right drug to the right patient can be seamless and easy when you use Code scanners. The Code technology you choose simply depends on your unique workflow &nbsp;<a href="http://services.codecorp.com/select/">(we would love to help you choose)</a>. True mobility options are now also available with hospitals eager to keep their enterprise-grade Code scanning power using their phones and tablets. Check out the <a href="https://info.codecorp.com/blog/soft-scanning-cost-of-ownership-breakdown">software scanning cost comparison </a>and <a href="https://info.codecorp.com/blog/setting-the-new-precedent-for-mobility-in-healthcare">case study </a>to learn more.</p><h3><strong>Positive Expressed Breast Milk Identification</strong></h3><p>Newborn babies need to eat frequently to ensure their continued health and strength. With those frequent feedings, the chances of feeding a baby the wrong <a href="https://info.codecorp.com/blog/positive-breast-milk-identification-expressed-breast-milk-ebm-solution">Expressed Breast Milk (EBM) </a>increase drastically. As there are potential health risks associated with feeding a baby the wrong EBM, special care should be taken to ensure the right EBM goes to the right baby. It was clear that barcode technology could be used to solve the problem at hand, which is where Code stepped in to help. Code scanners and engineers have been integral in helping develop a custom healthcare solution&nbsp;that scans a mother’s patient wristband, sends a signal via Bluetooth to a printer, and then prints a barcode label for EBM vial that corresponds with a barcode on the infant’s wristband.</p><p>When it comes to scanning barcodes on tiny infant wristbands, on the curved walls of EBM vials, or through incubator glass, Code scanners outperform the competition and ensure a lightning-fast and correct scan every&nbsp;<strong>time.</strong></p><h3><strong>Workflow and Supply Chain Management</strong></h3><p>Almost any workflow problem you have can be solved using a barcode system and Code scanners. Are your disposable gloves almost out of stock? Is your printer ink running low? Setting up a barcode solution with Code can help your hospital maintain a seamless supply chain and workflow. Code software can be programmed to automatically reorder supplies when inventory hits certain levels. In addition, barcodes can be utilized to track more sensitive things such as surgical instruments as they go through the sterilization process.</p><h3><strong>Pharmacy Applications</strong></h3><p>Scanning barcodes on medications is a much more involved process than scanning barcodes on jeans at Target. Settling for a scanner that reads only basic barcodes won’t cut it in the healthcare industry. Drug barcodes can include multiple pieces of information like expiration dates, lot numbers, and the FDA-required National Drug Code (NDC).</p><p>Code scanners uniquely read dozens of symbologies (even at the same time) and are easily set up at pharmacy counters to scan medications as they leave. The information on those medication labels can then be tracked and read with confidence never worrying if you’ll be able to scan the barcode and get all the information you need when you need it. Code scanners and decoding technology continues to read barcodes that other\'s simply can\'t.</p><h3><strong>Vendor Credentialing</strong></h3><p>Vendor credentialing is a huge part of effectively&nbsp;gate-keeping&nbsp;the privacy, security, and safety of patients and staff due to all of the outside helping hands coming in and out of the hospital on a daily basis. There is an efficient, new way to pass off on vendors entering the hospital\'s premises, and that is automatic vendor credentialing.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://info.codecorp.com/blog/authority-and-access-made-easy-in-healthcare">Vendors can get assigned a barcode, scan, print their pass, and go!&nbsp;</a></p><h3><strong>Lab and Specimen Collection and Tracking</strong></h3><p>When working with blood, lab cultures, or other specimens, mixups can be deadly.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://info.codecorp.com/blog/track-trace-and-verify-lab-samples-with-code-readers">Using barcode tracking significantly reduces the chances of a potentially hazardous&nbsp;mixup.</a></p><p>&nbsp;Additionally, it is imperative to use sterile equipment in these processes to avoid cross contamination. The unique plastics formula used in the mobile and handheld Code scanners feature CodeShield® technology, which seals out dust, debris, and contaminants—all while being made to withstand a laundry list of of disinfectants. Sterilizing a Code scanner is a breeze and won’t damage any of the electronic components.&nbsp;Your lab can work with assurance it is protected and operating at peak efficiency.</p><h3><strong>Blood and Saline Bag Scanning</strong></h3><p>Scanning a blood or saline bag and matching them to the patient are very critical elements in the healthcare workflow. With a blood bag, there are so many barcodes to scan on a single bag, which makes the process of trying to hide and scan the right ones—in the right order, stressful and time consuming. Saline bags create a different workflow problem by possessing a single white barcode printed on the transparent, reflective bag.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://info.codecorp.com/blog/blood-bag-scanning-scan-once-and-done">Is there a solution for scanning complicated barcodes and parsing only correct information needed ignoring the rest? </a>Why, yes there is a solution, it is called Code.</p><p><i>Ready for Code to change the way you work?&nbsp;</i><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/healthcare-datacapture/#demo"><i>Request a demo</i></a><i>&nbsp;from one of our trained professionals today, and see how Code can transform your hospital workflow for the better!</i></p>',

For this new testing system, the CR1500 is tethered to the analyzer developed by our partner. The scanner identifies the correct assay and patient, helping to match and track the test and materials throughout the process. Code’s scanner and custom-tailored software ensures the data scanned provides immediate and accurate results.</p><h2><strong>Benefits</strong></h2><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3dd8572a9fc60476ce0aa012dc509addfed54088/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f4352313530302e6a7067" alt="CR1500"></figure><p>The molecular diagnostics company chose the CR1500 scanner for the testing system because of the benefits they deemed critical. Among these is the use of CodeShield® plastics. This proprietary plastic can withstand the harsh medical disinfectants and without degrading. This material will not crack over time or be at risk of damage even with repeated cleanings throughout the day</p><p>In addition to industry-leading scanning technology, Code’s ability to customize and their strategic approach to OEM relationships also impacted the decision. Code ensures seamless and consistent integration of the scanning systems needed to support the requirements within the FDA environment. For essential healthcare data such as this, there is no room for error.</p><p>As healthcare evolves during this epidemic, choosing the right partner and product means the difference between saving lives and wasting time.</p><h2><strong>Additional Considerations</strong></h2><p>Additional considerations for choosing the CR1500 included its ergonomic qualities: the unit is lightweight, easy to handle, and fits well in the hand. Durable and well designed, it withstands drops and bumps without damage to the scanning mechanism or glass. With an IP54 rating, the CR1500 resists water and can be rinsed under a faucet if needed. The barcode decoding speed leads the industry and provides first-time, every-time accuracy. The image-based reading ensures that the scanner will be as effective in the future as it is when it first arrives.</p><p>Finally, according to our partner, the choice to go with the CR1500 was also based on Code’s responsiveness and flexibility. We make sure that answer questions and that you have access to any help you might need. Building relationships matters as much as selling scanners. We strive for long-term partnerships that help your business become more successful.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/536/code_logo_300x80.jpg"></figure><p>At Code, we are honored to be part of a solution to the growing concern about the COVID-19 virus.

Most hospitals or healthcare facilities have dedicated barcodes scanners on carts in each patient room, office, lab, surgical room, and so on. Patients wear wristbands with a barcode printed on them. This barcode holds all of the patient information located within the EHR. Every time a nurse, doctor, or other healthcare professional interacts with the patient, they scan the wristband to see the medical history, allergies, time of last medication administered and dosage, etc. When the healthcare provider administers a new IV or medication, they scan the barcode on the medication or IV bag to make sure it matches the patient’s information and there are no conflicts with that particular medicine. This also updates the EHR in real-time eliminating charting errors.</p><p>According to Health Management Technology, “When doctors and nurses can work more efficiently and care for patients more thoroughly during their shift, they save the hospital time and resources. Additionally, as more healthcare practices convert to electronic medical records, barcode solutions eliminate manual data collection and allow all patient information to be easily and instantly collected and recorded electronically, further reducing potential human error.”</p><p>Healthcare facilities require quick, reliable, and accurate scanning that reads every barcode with ease. More hospitals and healthcare facilities in the United States rely on Code than any other brand thanks to the powerful decoding algorithm found in Code’s scanning innovations. Code’s technology reads more than 40 barcode symbologies with zero-miss functionality on any surface – a mission-critical aspect for the healthcare industry. We stand behind, in front of, and next to our products. In short, Code barcode readers simply outlast and outperform the competition with a warranty exceeding industry norms and extended warranty options that match refresh cycles.</p><p>The healthcare industry also identifies mobility as a critical factor. A nurse or healthcare professional needs to have the ability to move from place to place as part of their job function. After decades spent learning and understanding the different healthcare workflows, Code understands mobility better than anyone. As a result, the most popular healthcare barcode scanning solutions are the Bluetooth® wireless CR2600 and CR2700 as well as the CortexDecoder software-based, mobile scanning solution that integrates within a mobile HIS system.</p><h2><strong>What is a soft-scanning for Mobile HIS?</strong></h2><p>Many of the major health information systems have an application (app) version of their HIS operating system that connects in real-time and holds all of the information from the main HIS. Using the app on a phone or tablet turned the EHRs mobile and offered healthcare organizations a more cost-efficient option to many of the patient care workflows.</p><p>In the beginning, manual data entry errors and inefficiencies plagued early adaptors. Pitfalls included an inability to gain quick access to the mobile HIS work environment and the inability to find patient information quickly. The integrations of software-based barcode scanning as a feature within the mobile HIS app delivered the needed functionality that had been missing. The soft-scanning innovation offered, for example, the option to scan a badge to gain instant access to the mobile HIS or scanning a patient wrist band to find any patient information on record. By using the camera on their mobile device to capture the valuable barcode data and Code’s powerful barcode scanning algorithm to decode it, healthcare teams now have the mobile enterprise solutions they had been asking for.</p><p>Today, mobility means carrying a powerful computer in your pocket, and soft-scanning integrations offer enterprise-grade barcode scanning with no scanning hardware. Healthcare and IT teams have a choice when looking at patient workflows and many no longer see the need for the additional expense of dedicated desktops in patient rooms.</p><h2><strong>Scanning Software (Soft-Scanning) to the Rescue</strong></h2><p>You can find integration of Code’s soft-scanning (CortexDecoder) embedded in many of the top mobile healthcare information systems. The Integration of mobile soft-scanning is a huge win for healthcare. If your HIS is missing this valuable barcode scanning feature, we would love to chat and help you explore the different options available. Your healthcare network of users will be grateful and so will their patients.</p><h2><strong>Wrap Up</strong></h2><p>We are staring at the very real future of enterprise mobile adoption for healthcare information systems. Barcodes and accurate barcode scanning have proven essential for efficient, accurate, and safe patient care. Not all software-based barcode scanning is created equal. Enterprise soft-scanning from Code has been engineered to deliver the ability to scan and decode barcodes of any symbology, color, size, or on any surface. Compensating for reflection, low light, or damage Code not only scans a single barcode, but can scan many at the same time depending on workflow needs. Code scanning technology has been the data capture solution for over 20 years in healthcare and will continues to champion innovation far into the future.</p><p><strong>Sources</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.healthit.gov/patients-families/better-information-means-safer-health-care">https://www.healthit.gov/patients-families/better-information-means-safer-health-care</a><br><a href="https://www.healthmgttech.com/the-role-of-barcode-technology-in-patient-safety-and-identification.php">https://www.healthmgttech.com/the-role-of-barcode-technology-in-patient-safety-and-identification.php</a></p>',

Their smaller size means they travel location to location and take up less space than a laptop or a desktop. These advantages make them highly desirable for a number of different industries. However, these modern miracles have drawbacks as well. They get broken or damaged easily if dropped; they don’t have as much memory as a desktop or laptop (though that is changing), and several functions don\'t work well compared to traditional computers and software.</p><p>Of the many functions that smartphones excel at, barcode scanning tops the list. The built-in camera can capture barcodes, and with the proper software installed or app downloaded, can interpret the barcode and reveal the data within. Because of this advanced capability, industries ranging from retail to warehousing, to healthcare have turned to smartphones as an option for their scanning needs.</p><h4><strong>Downfalls and Limitations</strong></h4><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/03a9b3867faf94effce6de54549cea9c378567a5/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f345f696d6167652d392e706e67" alt="image-9"></figure><p>Unfortunately, most barcode scanning apps struggle with truly enterprise-grade scanning requirements.&nbsp; Many scanning apps do nothing more than reading QR codes in marketing campaigns. The novelty of scanning a code with your cell phone and being directed to a website ruled advertising for a time. While the QR code still exists and maintains its popularity, the algorithms used in the app software fail to handle anything more complex.</p><p>Algorithms power effective barcode scanning, whether in a smartphone or a scanning device specifically designed for that purpose. Algorithms, the heart of the scanning software, truly determine the effectiveness of a device used for scanning. The software that powers the device determines successful scanning workflows. Algorithms make up the mathematical instructions that direct electronic devices to follow certain commands and perform functions. Every app available to download contains a set of instructions for your phone or computer to follow. They allow your cellphone to work as a camera, a video recorder, a television screen, or just a phone.</p><h4><strong>You Get What You Pay For</strong></h4><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/be724666c874d931d779f247959a21946036fde7/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f325f626c6f622e6a7067" alt="blob"></figure><p>Apps available for free download have been somewhat successful, but they also suffer from some significant flaws. Most of the free apps are created for very basic scanning needs such as price comparison, limited product identification, or asset location. For these low-demand needs, a free app may be all an individual or company needs. The free "price" appears good; however, the old adage “You get what you pay for,” applies here. With more than 40 types of barcode symbology, it’s unlikely that a software developer creating free downloadable apps knows all of them. Given that new symbologies appear regularly, a free app programmer probably can\'t keep up with the ever-changing codes.</p><p>Highly specific barcode scanning needs require even greater assurance that the software performs as needed. In hospital settings, lives depend on the speed and accuracy of barcode scanning. The algorithms must instantly read and interpret the barcode, even if it appears on a shiny surface or among other barcodes. No free, downloadable app can guarantee “first time, every time” accuracy.</p><h4><strong>Who Knows Best</strong></h4><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/70b5f4bcf2764d830d0df507a87dbaf4ef29e25a/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f536f66742d5363616e6e696e6732304d6f62696c653230417070323049636f6e32302d3230426c61636b32303138303230783230313832323053616c65732e706e67" alt="Soft-Scanning Mobile App Icon - Black 180 x 182 (Sales)"></figure><p>When it comes to barcode scanning on an enterprise scale, look for apps designed by companies whose primary business is barcode scanning. Companies like Code® produce barcode scanning software that can read all the symbologies currently in use. Our computer scientists are among the best in the world at creating algorithms that capture exactly the data you need. They can optimize the information according to whether you’re using a smartphone, tablet, or barcode scanning device. They can also include programming that helps your device scan in low or bright light, from odd angles, at greater distances, on reflective surfaces, and even read damaged or smudged barcodes.</p><p>Many free apps perform well within limited parameters. If your company\'s scanning demands are narrow, this could meet your needs. However, if your company needs more than just one or two barcodes read, or if you need performance that expands your capabilities, Code offers a number of consumer apps and enterprise apps for consumer devices.&nbsp; We can help you determine what your needs are and show you how we can best meet them.</p><figure class="image"><img src="/storage/551/code_logo_300x80.jpg"></figure><h4><strong>Call Code</strong></h4><p>Contact us today to learn more about the options available to improve your unique circumstances.

Getting overwhelmed might seem inevitable. It pays to have some helpful guidance from a company that has been down this road multiple times.</p><p>Code’s engineers and customer service team developed this checklist to guide you in choosing your scanning SDK. We have over 20 years of success helping clients implement barcode scanning into manufacturing processes and business applications. This checklist helps you research and identify a scanning solution and the vendor that will best deliver on your requirements.</p><p>You can request a free Barcode Scanning Software Proof-of-Concept document by speaking with a sales representative.</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Develop Your Requirements</strong></h3><p>At the beginning of your search, you may not have a complete picture of what you’re looking for. All quests begin with the first step. Start by developing your barcode scanning requirements and affirming them with the stakeholders in your company. Determine up front the non-negotiable requirements and the mission-critical requirements. You should also include the “we’d love to have this” options. This list can save headaches down the road. Connect with team members who\'ll be involved with the decision and those who\'ll rely on your decision for their job. It’s important you verify terms and terminology and reach a clear understanding of what everyone involved wants in this solution. You don\'t want to be arguing semantics near the end when you thought you’d already reached an agreement.</p><p>Try to reach consensus on:</p><ul><li>What is the issue this barcode scanning software is primarily intended to address?</li><li>Who will be using the product?</li><li>How will the software be implemented?</li><li>Are there minimum requirements the software must meet?</li><li>What are parameters of the data capture?</li><li>Are there goals your organization hopes to achieve with the addition of this embedded software solution?</li><li>What deadlines do you have that will impact this process?</li></ul><p>As you work with your team and stakeholders, you’ll find other questions to be addressed as well. Designate someone to record the additional questions you’ll uncover and be sure to ask them. You can also ask us here at Code what the most important factors are for you to address. We will provide you with straight-forward, honest answers as you begin your search. When you’ve got answers to as many questions as you could identify, move on to the next step.</p><h3><strong>Step 2: Begin Your Research</strong></h3><p>Finding a vendor that is the right fit for your needs can seem like finding that one sock that’s gone missing in the dryer.&nbsp; Start by reviewing any marketing materials collected at tradeshows or received in your inbox.</p><p>Perform an internet search for “barcode decoder” or “barcode scanning software.” This will result in pages of topics and include the top barcode scanning choices. Focus your search on these top-listed vendors. Check out the company websites and read customer testimonials. Add to your list of questions things you want to ask, and ask others to review the materials and sites.</p><p>All of this should give you a feel for who might be a good fit. It will help you identify whether or not you think they can provide the barcode scanning software you need. There are other sources you can look to as well, including:</p><ul><li>White Papers – a chance to look at in-depth topics relating to the company and their scanning solutions.</li><li>Blogs - topics the company feels knowledgable on enough to share with the public.</li><li>LinkedIn – a good place to learn how the company conducts business. You can read some of their press coverage and see how they interact with their employees and other companies.</li></ul><p>Once you’ve gathered the data you need, develop a list of your top candidates to move to the next step. Three or four candidates are typically sufficient.</p><h3><strong>Step 3: Demonstration and Test Drive</strong></h3><p>You’ve determined what your needs are.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/cb42562e6ded73de5fdf27c3d69900497f0f1149/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f6c69766564656d6f2e6a7067" alt="Image result for demo"></figure><p>You’ve investigated potential vendors to see how they can meet your needs. Now it’s time to kick the tires and take the software for a spin.</p><p>When you’re ready for the software demo, review your list of questions and create a checklist of performance expectations. Take thorough notes and make sure anyone who is joining you for the presentation does the same.</p><p>The more information you collect from the demo, the more thorough your understanding will be of this software solution. Work through the demos from your short-list of candidates, helping further narrow your list. When you settle on a company and solution that seems to meet your expectations, set up a free trial.&nbsp; This will let you gauge the actual performance of the software within your environment.</p><p>During your trial period, create challenge scenarios for the barcode scanning software to see how it performs under the best, and worst, case scenarios:</p><ul><li>Low light or changing light situations</li><li>Repeated, rapid scanning</li><li>Multiple code types</li><li>Damaged codes</li><li>Hard-to-read/faint codes</li><li>Curved surface reads</li><li>Uneven surface reads</li><li>Small/blurred codes</li><li>Data collection and accuracy</li></ul><p>This is an opportunity to find other areas you may want this solution to address that hadn’t previously been discovered. This is also a good time to evaluate the customer support and service the vendor provides. It’s important to know the level of responsiveness and expertise long before you have an actual need for it.</p><p>For example, Code offers a free trial of the barcode scanning SDK that can integrate with your specific needs and with your existing systems. This includes systems such as the Android, IOS, Windows, MacOS, Linux or other operating systems. You can decide which barcode symbologies to include in your free trial, plus much more. We fine-tune the software for your evaluation so you can experience first-hand how the software performs under your circumstances. And we will provide feedback on how you can optimize for the best possible performance even under less than ideal scanning environments.</p><h4><strong>Step 4: Recommendation</strong></h4><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/554/we_recommend_300w.jpg"></figure><p>So, all your research, demos, trial tests, and team feedback have compressed into the final evaluation steps. However, there may be a few parts of the evaluation that have yet to fall into place. Some of those final pieces may include:</p><ul><li>Software licensing options and flexibility</li><li>Price quotes for various software configurations</li><li>Implementation costs and customization additions</li><li>Support, maintenance, or upgrade costs</li><li>Non-Disclosure Agreements signed</li><li>Contracts prepared and signed</li></ul><p>Attending to these finishing pieces will help you move into the final vendor recommendation with clarity and confidence. They will also make the transition to onboarding your new barcode reading software much easier.</p><h3><strong>Step 5: Implementation</strong></h3><p>Implementation is really where the rubber meets the road. If you’ve done your homework and selected the best vendor, then implementation should hum along like a finely-tuned engine.</p><p>Sometimes, however, misguided vendors try to use a one-size-fits-all approach. They want to pull your software from their standard box-of-solutions and apply it to your company. After all, it worked for the companies that came before you. If you complain, they become hard to work with and hard to get support from. This will slow or even stop the implementation you envisioned.</p><p>Code customizes implementation and support to meet the needs of each individual client whether that company is large or small. Code gives you access to an experienced technical team and engineers who make implementing your software easy and smooth. We provide additional consultation and training to make certain that your staff is knowledgeable on your solution. And we are available for ongoing support, so your adoption and integration are flawless.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="/storage/555/game_plan_300w.jpg"></figure><p>Many companies claim they can supply and support an enterprise-grade barcode scanning and decoding software solution. Not all of them specialize specifically in this application like Code does. It’s important to be clear about your expectations and needs, to conduct a thorough evaluation of the vendors, and to test the software in the conditions it will be used.</p><p>Your barcode scanning SDK research and evaluation should uncover exactly what you’re looking for. This checklist will help take you down the recommendation road.&nbsp; For more help, let Code show you how our years of experience in barcode reading algorithms, dedication to service, and superior quality can benefit your organization.

And businesses should be doing the same with their barcodes!</p><p>Did you know that there is a way to utilize a secure barcode that cannot be decoded or copied? Crazy, huh? <strong>Code offers a secure, unique two-dimensional (2D) barcode symbology called </strong><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/gocode-secure-barcode/"><strong>GoCode</strong></a><strong>®.</strong> If you have a company that is at risk of counterfeiting problems or that just needs advanced security (pharmaceuticals for example), then GoCode might just be what you have been looking for.</p><p>Utilizing the GoCode barcode symbology gives the company the benefit of having their own private barcode. How? Well, Code developed this symbology to contain an adaptable matrix pattern that can be reproduced on basically any surface. Cool, I know. Plus these barcodes can be made with user verification features, which means<strong> the data may only be read by approved readers</strong>.</p><h2><strong>GoCode-barcode</strong></h2><p>GoCode barcodes have more benefits than just the security (like how your phone does more than just call people). The readability of this code is unparalleled, and as an added bonus it features a multi-resolution matrix that ensures critical data can be retrieved from even the most damaged condition.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/26eab1c2a9cf386b2d9bea76dc3b501cdd712fe8/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f476f436f64652d626172636f64652e6a7067" alt="GoCode-barcode"></figure><p>One important thing to note, GoCode barcodess are one of the only symbologies that can operate in the space confinement of common text, AND they are the most customizable barcode on the market, meaning it can hold more data within its small size than any other 2D barcode. Have I peaked your security-hungry interest?</p><p>With the digital world we live in, data security has moved to the top of virtually every companies priority list and efforts to protect important and sensitive information is at your fingertips. The GoCode symbology can keep your sensitive data safe from any eyes that shouldn\'t have access and all counterfeiting as well as add a level of extra security everyone will appreciate and thank you for.</p><p><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/portfolio-items/gocode-secure-barcode/">Visit our website</a> to read more on GoCode or contact us for a demo.

Companies rely on employees’ familiarity with smartphones, and they take advantage of this trend in their own mobile device workflows. Leveraging the benefits of smartphones in the workplace requires informed decision-making. This becomes especially clear when evaluating and deploying barcode scanning software apps available on the market today. (<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/247266">https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/247266</a>)</p><p>Interested in adopting barcode reading, executives turned to the surge of QR code scanning popularized by marketing industries. Using third party applications downloaded to iOS®, Android™, and Windows® devices, companies added a new dimension to advertising. A few hundred different vendors on App Store®, Google Play™, Windows Store, and other sites give away or sell these scanning apps. (<a href="http://www.business2community.com/marketing/qr-codes-thriving-dying-">http://www.business2community.com/marketing/qr-codes-thriving-dying-</a> 01228016#IXF18yREHOfvFjo8.97)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Pros and Cons of Consumer Grade Apps</strong></h2><p>Free or inexpensive apps became common in the late 1990s and early 2000s.Today, many companies turn to these free or inexpensive apps for barcode scanning needs within their workflows. However, taking a few things into consideration when planning to roll out enterprise solutions will save time, money, and aggravation. Many of these apps require additional software developed to handle the challenges faced in barcode scanning workflows. Also, these apps rarely work with every operating system. Users often need to seek additional programming assistance to reach the level of functionality they desire. (<a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/">https://searchenginewatch.com/ sew/how-to/2066777/top-14-things-marketers-need-know-about-qr-codes</a>)</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bee68b2784d00615f3aa74baf42f894abd2d94d1/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f626172636f6465323073616d706c65732e706e67" alt="barcode samples"></figure><p>Many barcode types, or symbologies, other than QR Codes&nbsp; exist in enterprise applications. 2D barcodes, developed for the purpose of packing thousands of data characters into the same space as a 1D barcode, gained popularity in the 1990s. Several 2D barcode symbologies came about to accommodate enterprise workflows. These symbologies feature characteristics such as small physical size and unique shape depending on the asset being labeled. Barcode types often get imposed upon the organization by external suppliers and companies must conform to their use. However, specific industries often develop their own symbologies for use within that industry.</p><h2><strong>What Does Free Really Buy?</strong></h2><p>Free QR Code scanner apps can read only QR codes, or possibly a few 2D type barcodes. In addition, those apps probably won\'t read additional symbologies required for scanning by the phone. Scanning versatility allows users to optimize performance by toggling off unneeded symbologies, but free barcode readers typically don\'t have this option. Worker productivity requires an employee to scan a barcode swiftly and reliably without having to re-scan. A weak decoding algorithm, or a damaged or poorly printed barcode, causes a user to re-scan the same barcode and wait for a successful read. Rescanning leads to wasted time and frustration.</p><p>The average smartphone camera includes a high mega-pixel image sensors and lens systems. In fact, camera phone resolution has improved to the point where it competes with purpose-built scanners.&nbsp; The real secret to enterprise-level performance comes from the decoder algorithm and the design expertise behind it. The algorithms driving scanning apps work the same in smartphones as in purpose-built scanners. The choice in scanner depends on the type or purpose of the scanning itself.</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ade08982554bff3db7dc8eb8e508f6dcbada541d/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f626f617264696e673230706173732e706e67" alt="boarding pass"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Barcode scanning has also moved beyond packaging in terms of the media on which barcodes are printed. Environmental efforts to reduce dependence on paper, and smartphone-centric lifestyles, increased demand for reading barcodes off smartphone LCD screens. Applications vary, but some familiar examples include: passing loyalty or coupon information from a smartphone to a point of sale (POS) system, and&nbsp; presenting an electronic boarding pass at an airline terminal gate. 2D mobile barcode scanning continues growing daily. (<a href="https://www.cmocouncil.org/facts-stats-categories.php?view=all&amp;category=mobile-marketing">https://www.cmocouncil.org/facts-stats-categories.php?view=all&amp;category=mobile-marketing</a>)</p><h2><strong>Further Complicating Issues</strong></h2><p>An enterprise device needs to be fit for the job at hand. Many times free QR code software apps utilize a revenue model that depends on consumers clicking on ads placed within the program. Pop-up ads, banners, logos, or irrelevant notifications that block a view of the screen are a hassle. They interfere with scanning efficiency and cause user frustration. Anything which confuses or distracts an employee from scanning costs the company time and money. One dissatisfied customer commented on Amazon about a typical QR scanner app: “ with ads that keep taking up screen space. I deleted it about ten minutes after downloading it. Will look for something better.” (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/ScanLife-QR-Code-Barcode-Reader/product-reviews/%20B004XJNLQO?filterByStar=one_star&amp;pageNumber=1">http://www.amazon.com/ScanLife-QR-Code-Barcode-Reader/product-reviews/ B004XJNLQO?filterByStar=one_star&amp;pageNumber=1</a>)</p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6dc8e148cebe6c355df0f10d970ca421a08f75ec/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f63656c6c7363616e6e2e706e67" alt="cellscann"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Underlying programs may capture device or usage data which could cause a company security issue. Enterprise software, like CortexDecoder®, comes with no embedded malware or ads. It supports an end user’s goal of getting the barcode scanning job done efficiently and effectively without distraction.</p><p>When deploying a new scanning solution, having confidence that technical support is only a phone call away is key. App stores don\'t discriminate against individuals or companies uploading their QR code scanner apps. These individuals or small job shops typically don\'t have the capacity to provide reliable customer support or robust technical documentation. When choosing a scanning software, make sure to choose a company that stands behind their product. And make sure they give the support necessary to make business applications run quickly.</p><h2><strong>Solutions to These Issues Do Exist</strong></h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Companies looking at deploying smartphone-based barcode scanning software should ensure these issues get top priority:</p><ul><li>Barcode variety</li><li>Scan speed and performance</li><li>Clutterless screens</li><li>Security</li><li>Vendor support</li></ul><p>When asked about their industry-leading SDK, CortexDecoder®, Code’s CEO Kent Hansen, remarked, “There are many software-based barcode reading options on the market today, but they lack the performance and reliability that is both expected and required to meet the demands of enterprises.

In the US alone in 2016, adults spent $72.7 billion on lottery tickets of all kinds. With jackpots reaching into the hundreds of millions of dollars, lottery fever catches people from all walks of life, and people will go to extreme lengths to try to cheat the system. Every day, millions of people hand over hard-earned money for a chance at wealth, and every day, thousands of others scheme ways to defraud the system. In both cases, the lure of instant wealth (or even just an extra 20 bucks), draws folks to play some form of a lottery ticket.</p><h2><strong>And so it Goes...</strong></h2><p>Lottery history follows an interesting and winding path. The American colonies used lotteries to gain financial footing and bank role a young, growing nation. Gaming revenue also helped construct railroads across the continent in the 19th century. Lotteries fell out of favor at the beginning of the 20th century in both the US and Europe, with countries restricting them or banning them outright and remaining that way until after World War II. Today, however, many state education budgets in the US receive between 5 and 30 percent of their budget (or more) from lottery earnings.</p><p>In October 2002, the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries (NASPL) created a set of technical standards for lotteries across North America to protect the integrity, security, interoperability, and profitability of those operations. In Europe, The European Lotteries (EL) is the umbrella organization of national lotteries operating games of chance for the public benefit. EL brings together state-owned and private operators, both profit and non-profit, who operate on behalf of the state. These bodies help ensure gaming operates ethically and efficiently for the benefit of those who chose to play.</p><h2><strong>Barcode Scanning Decreases Fraud</strong></h2><p>Among recent changes to lotteries around the globe, the addition of barcodes and barcode scanning technology leads the way as a deterrent to fraud. A majority of lottery tickets are now printed with barcode technology that ensures the accuracy of the information on the ticket and protects against counterfeiting and any attempts at altering the ticket. The use of QR codes, 1D, and 2D barcodes has helped to decrease fraud as well as to increase efficiency in the lottery arena. Barcodes printed on all types of lottery tickets, from scratchers to Megabucks dissuade would-be criminals and protect ticket authenticity. Because of the amount and types of data which can be encrypted in barcodes, and the safety of the encryption within those barcodes, they have become a nearly ubiquitous part of all types of lotteries.</p><p>The use of scanners for the barcodes, and barcode scanning software programmed specifically for the agencies overseeing instant win and big drawing events, also aids in the fight against fraud and helps improve service. Omnidirectional scanners, either hand-held or incorporated into the transaction register or terminal, ensure quick (typically milliseconds) reading of the ticket data which is instantly transmitted to the government or private organization responsible for overseeing the lottery ticket sales. For instant win tickets, the data scanned in the barcode can be compared against the lottery list of winning numbers for an immediate yes or no answer and identify where the ticket was sold. These registers or terminals can be found at lottery retailers such as convenience stores, grocery stores, liquor stores, and lottery locations.</p><h2><strong>Customized Lottery Data Capture Solutions</strong></h2><p>CODE tailors and customizes data capture solutions that include both enterprise-grade hardware and software ensuring individual lottery partners the data retrieved from each ticket meets their specific requirements. The data capture hardware and software also scan licenses or identification cards to ensure that tickets are being sold to legal age patrons as well as ensuring the efficacy of the transactions themselves.</p><p>At Code Corporation, our decoding algorithms allow us to specialize in secure data capture technologies that meet all these criteria and more. From eliminating counterfeiting issues or applications needing advanced security (proprietary symbology GoCode®) to advanced barcode scanners and decoding software that can compensate for damage or scan multiple barcodes at once, Code products deliver not only time savings but also offer greater convenience and a better user experience. Code’s scanning and decoding technology provides the security solutions the gaming and lottery industry values and delivers the accuracy and efficiency they need.</p><h2><strong>Code Can Help</strong></h2><p>As criminals become ever more sophisticated, and the risks to this industry increase, a solution is required to be flexible and adaptable.

Barcode scanning supports healthcare’s&nbsp; performance and makes it even better. How, you might ask? By reducing or eliminating adverse drug events (ADEs), increasing patient safety, and eliminating transcription errors. Government mandates made data capture solutions a necessary part of operations at every healthcare facility. Data capture solutions ensure patient safety through regular checks and documentation. Using unique identifiers (barcodes) attached to patients, medications, equipment, and pretty much every item located in a healthcare setting, facilities save time, money, and add patient security. Cleaning, inventory, and hospitality crews use data capture solutions to track room cleanings, patient nutrition, and equipment maintenance. Those little barcodes perform a very big job.</p><h2><strong>So why does it matter?</strong></h2><p>It matters because each workflow requires various types of barcode scanners to keep things running efficiently. And despite what you may have been told, <strong>one size does not fit all in scanning.</strong></p><p>Due to the scanner being near to patients, barcode scanners used for hospitals with inpatient bedside medication administration, or emergency departments, receive extra scrutiny by infection control teams. These workflows require a completely sealed barcode scanner that withstands the constant cleaning and sanitizing. Inventory crew scanners don’t require the same sterilization, but they may need to handle multiple barcodes at high speeds at the same time.</p><h3><strong>There are three basic types of barcode scanners designed to handle a wide range of tasks:</strong></h3><ol><li><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/categories.php?show=all"><strong>Tethered(attached to a PC)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/categories.php?show=all"><strong>Bluetooth&nbsp;(like your favorite speaker) or</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.codecorp.com/categories.php?show=all"><strong>Mobile units&nbsp;(can move from room to room)</strong></a></li></ol><p><strong>Tethered</strong> units&nbsp; predominantly get used in clinical workflows like outpatient doctors’ offices, pharmacies, or labs. Generally, tethered units cost less, but their cords often get in the way in an inpatient setting. Inpatient environments are more complex.

            'page_text' => '<h2><strong>How Do You Improve Patient Safety Worldwide? With Intelligence and Zero-Miss Barcode Reading Automation.</strong></h2><p>Patient safety ranks as one of the most critical healthcare goals. Patient safety includes anything from collecting information to administering the right medication. So many factors contribute to the daily battle for healthcare professionals. Fortunately, ZiuZ Medical has placed the identification and validation of automatically dispensed medication in the “certified and mastered” column worldwide.</p><p>ZiuZ Medical, a global visual intelligence company based out of the Netherlands, set out to help pharmacies. By using automatic dose dispensing systems to assemble and package patient medications Ziuz hoped to save time and reduce errors. Once a pill leaves a bottle, it also loses its identity. As staff members hand medications off, they may not remember what it is–especially when many pills look so similar.</p><p>Automatic dose dispensing comes to the rescue with the ability to individually package pills together. This automation is so precise that only the medicines intended for a specific patient get delivered to that patient. But what happens if during that automation process the wrong pills get placed into the package? Using 13 parameters, near-infrared (NIR) image analysis technologies, and intelligent algorithms, ZiuZ identifies each pill or capsule within each bag. The automation process runs at a rate of 6 inches per second giving each medication pack an approval or rejection and ensuring only the correct medication is ever placed in each bag.</p><h2><strong>Getting a Grip on Quality</strong></h2><p>One of the crucial elements for patient safety is dispensing the right drugs every time no matter what. Each patient has unique needs, making the treatment process varied and complicated. Ensuring that patients get the correct dosage of the correct drug is vital. Errors can be fatal.</p><p>In a study titled, “Medication errors: the importance of safe dispensing,” published by the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, the author identifies the most common causes of dispensing errors. The list includes: being busy, being short-staffed, being subject to time-constraints, fatigue of healthcare providers, interruptions during dispensing, and look-alike/sound-alike medicines (1).</p><p>Automatic dose dispensing and dispensing machines have been recommended as one potential mechanism to improve efficiency and patient safety. Many hospitals around the world use them in their internal pharmacies(2). These machines enhance the efficiency of medication distribution, but their capacity to reduce medication errors remains controversial and depends on many factors. In answer to quality concerns, ZiuZ Medical created an intelligent solution incorporating the best image-based barcode scanning software from Code Corporation®. A patient’s life can hinge on having a solution that automatically verifies the contents of each pill pack. Ensuring it contains the correct medication before it reaches the patient constitutes a healthcare win from any perspective.</p><h2><strong>Testing, Testing, 1 2 3</strong></h2><p>ZiuZ set out to find a way to easily identify each pill within every given medication pack assembled. They needed to compare that information with what should be located inside each package and immediately identify errors. This process required including difficult medicines and capsules and situations with broken pills or crumbs.</p><p>The ZiuZ intelligent system started with a detailed photograph of the transparent side of each bag. This showed the contents of the pouch, but it needed the ability to reliably scan and decode the 2D barcode. The barcode contains the details of what items should be found inside. This part played a crucial role. Without it, their technology would not be able to perform the verification/comparison to deliver a “match or error” result. ZiuZ needed to find an enterprise-grade, high-performing scanning solution that would scan the 2D barcode without fail. And it had to scan on the reflective surface of the bag. For most scanning software, this proved challenging. Then ZiuZ discovered CortexDecoder®.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/89c0301909d1cc3e81dc0183237f69a0d30a4add/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f696d6167652d31352e706e67" alt=""></figure><p>In healthcare, as in a lot of industries, time is a valuable resource. However, unlike most businesses, in healthcare, time is more than money. Life and death decisions are made in seconds. The right scanning solution would make checking packs of medication fast and accurate while reinforcing a superior product reputation. ZiuZ turned to Code Corporation, integrating CortexDecoder into the med pack checking device. The result? CortexDecoder delivered a scanning experience that exceeded all of ZiuZ’ expectations.</p><h2><strong>Prior to finding Code, ZiuZ Medical used a decoder that had an error rate of .05%.</strong></h2><p>Prior to CortexDecoder, 1 in every 200 barcodes misread the barcode. Potential for dispensing the wrong medication could have catastrophic consequences, an unacceptable result for ZiuZ. They continued searching for a decoding algorithm that met their demands. The decoding software ZiuZ needed had to deliver on three essential things:</p><ul><li>The error read rate needed to be as close to zero as possible</li><li>It needed to be able to read 2D barcodes moving at a speed of approximately 6 inches per second</li><li>It had to flawlessly decode from the reflective surface of the shiny, thin foil packs that could wrinkle and compromise the barcode readability</li></ul><p>Finding a barcode decoder algorithm to meet these exacting requirements seemed, at times, a nearly impossible task. ZiuZ tested several decoding platforms. Unfortunately, each one came with an issue that impeded their ability to function up to the standards. They knew their specifications were challenging, but they also believed the solution existed.</p><p>After investigating additional platforms, doubts began to filter into ZiuZ. But the benefits of their system and its ability to provide life-saving care to patients kept them searching. Ultimately they came upon Code. They were impressed with the power and versatility of CortexDecoder. A simple test drive of the enterprise SDK was all it took to move ZiuZ forward.</p><h2><strong>Enterprise Barcode Scanning Software Solution: CortexDecoder</strong></h2><p>The performance of CortexDecoder exceeded every one of ZiuZ\' expectations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CortexDecoder was able to scan thousands of barcodes before even one could be identified as an error.</strong></p><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8215f2314afe91ac25a67bb64df9c3acd706bee6/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f626c6f622d312e6a7067" alt="Medication delivery patients can trust"></figure><p>The 2D barcode printed on the back of the packets holds the information of which pills and how many are supposed to be in every pack. That information needs to match the photograph that the machine takes of the transparent side of the bag. These dispensing machines only have one chance to read each barcode that zooms by. CortexDecoder reads these barcodes with near zero-miss reliability, allowing the verification process to happen quickly and accurately. &nbsp;ZiuZ Medical found that integrating CortexDecoder into their system made their machines more efficient.

            'page_text' => '<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3><p>In the medical field, there are two absolute truths: equipment is expensive, and it must stay clean. If purchased equipment cannot withstand harsh chemical cleaners used in medical settings, it quickly goes from a patient care investment to an expensive&nbsp; paperweight.</p><p>Barcode readers are an invaluable resource in hospitals world-wide. From patient IDs to medication management, barcode scanners are part of modern medical workflows. However, it can be a challenge to find devices that complement each hospital’s demanding work environment yet also withstand the harsh cleaning necessary for infection control.</p><p>To some, antimicrobial plastics seem the most effective solution. However, many misconceptions surround what antimicrobial plastics offer compared to disinfectant-ready plastics. Understanding these differences helps medical facilities make better informed choices about the mobile equipment for their locations.</p><h3><strong>Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program</strong></h3><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ca919cba4400c2352f3078e15ea78ea1eeeadcc4/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f70657472692e706e67" alt="petri"></figure><p>According to a 2014 report on National Public Radio, “One out of every 8 patients nationally suffered a potentially avoidable complication during a hospital stay.”&nbsp;(1) Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services defines HACs as “a group of reasonably preventable conditions that patients did not have upon admission to a hospital, but which developed during the hospital stay.” By 2018, that number had declined to only 1 out of 31 patients. Progress has been made, but it hasn’t happened as fast as federal health officials would like. (2)</p><p>Under the Affordable Care Act, infection containment and reducing HACs has become a major focus. Medicare began a series of hospital evaluations looking at several HAC prevention areas and assigning each hospital an HAC score. As part of the HAC Reduction program, Medicare began penalizing hospitals with an insufficient HAC score(3).</p><p>According to Ann Farrell, Principal at Farrell Associates Health IT Consulting, LLC, “Financial penalties are driving C-Suite focus (e.g. chief operating officer, chief executive officer) on infection control.&nbsp; While HACs are multi-factorial, there is a growing awareness of the role devices taken room-to-room play in both spreading infection and prevention. These concerns have contributed to the rising number of in-room point-of-care device strategies and increasingly influence device vendor selection.” With this increased focus on infection control, the value of disinfectant-ready plastics that can withstand chemicals needed for infection containment and decreased HACs becomes paramount.</p><h3><strong>Antimicrobial vs. Disinfectant-Ready</strong></h3><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/592a0a9393285114aec745304825590d7308d64e/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f64616d6167652e706e67" alt="damage"></figure><p>According to Madison Group, an independent plastics testing company, antibacterial additives wear away with time. This means the plastic ceases to resist bacteria after prolonged use and repeated cleaning and disinfecting.&nbsp; Because antimicrobial additives are not inherent in the molecular structure, they weaken the plastic composition.</p><p>In an interview for Plastic News, Manish Nandi, Senior Product Developer for Sabic Innovative Plastics, gave insights on antimicrobial plastics. He mentioned that they are not a “cure-all” for disinfection and that, “the primary control is still going to be cleaning” with the antimicrobial additives acting as a sort of insurance policy.</p><p>This “insurance policy” may not account for substances used to clean the device. In reference to the harsh chemicals used to disinfect devices, Nandi said, “. . . to kill these really resistant bugs, they are coming up with harsher and harsher chemicals. And that is putting pressure on folks like us who are making the materials and surfaces because these materials are not friendly to the harsher chemicals.” (4)</p><p>Customers who choose antimicrobial devices could pay extra for a device that no longer remains antimicrobial. Or the customer spends more because the plastic has deteriorated from repeated exposure to harsh chemicals. In this age of cost control to make healthcare affordable, replacing devices for these reasons won\'t make that C-suite happy. The alternative is finding devices that do not suffer from this type of decomposition; devices that can withstand the rigors of daily use and daily cleanings in healthcare environments.</p><h3><strong>Medical Grade/Disinfectant Ready</strong></h3><figure class="image image-style-side"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/525e1f436280e976cab585a2aa05bb6652b20caa/68747470733a2f2f636f6465636f72702e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323032302f30362f6365727469666965642e706e67" alt="certified"></figure><p>The difference between antimicrobial and disinfectant-ready is similar to comparing something water resistant to something waterproof. While one offers you a minimum level of assurance, the other offers a guarantee. With financial punishment for HAC ratings, and focus on reducing costs, many medical facilities are looking for better options.</p><p>Disinfectant-ready materials won\'t break down when subjected to chemical disinfectants. The purpose of these plastic compositions is to withstand different levels of harsh chemical cleanings. Disinfectant resiliency varies from product to product in order to accommodate different microorganism levels of control. Manufacturers have different disinfectant chemical compositions in order to attack microorganisms in different ways. As a result, not all disinfectant-ready plastics are made equal.</p><h3><strong>How Code Can Help</strong></h3><p>The CDC recommends “Adequate cleaning and disinfection of equipment and environment” as part of infection control.&nbsp;(6) This recommendation requires that equipment endures the cleaning and disinfecting procedures without deterioration of materials or degradation of function.</p><p>Code offers a variety of scanning solutions for hospitals, each featuring CodeShield® Disinfectant-Ready plastics. These products can withstand repeated exposure to harsh cleaning and disinfectant products used in healthcare environments. (5)&nbsp; The number of scanning options available ensures hospitals and clinics can find the product they need with the durability required. This product longevity helps reduce replacement costs and gives hospitals and clinics another means of saving money in their facility.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Plastics injected with antimicrobial additives will resist growth of bacteria for an undetermined period of time. However, that does not eliminate the need to clean and disinfect the device. Antimicrobial plastic components are not made to withstand the harsh chemical cleaners found in healthcare environments. As a result, facilities that choose antimicrobial over disinfectant-ready plastics in their devices run the risk of spreading infections. They also risk degradation in both materials and performance, and costing healthcare facilities additional money for replacement devices. This not only increases the cost to patients, but hospitals may see an impact to HAC scores leading to impacts in Medicare and Medicaid funding.</p><p>With risks this significant, the choice seems relatively clear.</p><h3><strong>Sources</strong></h3><p>(1)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/06/23/323998618/hospitals-to-pay-big-fines-for-infections-avoidable-injuries">Hospitals To Pay Big Fines For Infections, Avoidable Injuries (NPR)</a>:</p><p>(2)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hai/data/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhai%2Fsurveillance%2Findex.html">HAI Data | CDC</a></p><p>&nbsp;(3)<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Downloads/HAC-Reduction-Program-Fact-Sheet.pdf">Medicare Fee-for-Service</a></p><p>(4)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20130913/NEWS/130919951/antimicrobial-plastics-play-role-in-disease-prevention">Anti-microbial plastics play role in disease prevention - Plastics News (Plastics News)</a></p><p>(5)&nbsp;<a href="http://codecorp.com/assets/data_sheet/Disinfectant-Ready-Plastics---Healthcare-Data-Sheet.pdf">Disinfectant-Ready Plastics Code Data Sheet</a></p><p>(6)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/Disinfection_Sterilization/1_sumIntroMethTerms.html#2">Centers for Disease Control</a></p>',

While improvements in size and portability have enabled a lot of business applications, there have been limitations to automating data capture at the point of transaction. This has led to huge investments in technological solutions that fall short of the last mile, meaning a lot of money was spent to reduce data entry errors, but all that spend couldn’t eliminate them completely. That is before TachyonIQ decoding algorithms entered the picture. With image processing power that is unrivaled, <strong>TachyonIQ turns any device with a camera into a high-performance, automatic data capture solution.</strong>&nbsp; From purpose-built barcode readers to PCs with USB cameras to webcams on All-in-One computers to iPhones and Galaxy smartphones, <strong>TachyonIQ gives enterprises new options to eliminate manual data entry, eliminate errors, increase efficiency, and ultimately cut costs to boost the bottom line.</strong></p><p>Traditional solutions are still viable, but give your company a leg up by studying some of the novel ways companies are solving their data capture problems.&nbsp;<strong>What follows is an overview of the new and clever ways automatic data capture solutions are being implemented and considerations for these implementations to ensure success.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Wherever, Whenever: The Expansion of Mobility</strong></h2><p>Portable Data Terminals have been around for decades, carry a price tag of a few thousand dollars to accomplish a fraction of what today’s mobile devices are capable of doing. Often these enterprise mobile products were bulky, ultra-rugged, and had an embedded barcode reader for data capture. Over the years, the products have gotten more streamlined and fuller featured to help businesses accomplish more, but with the advent of smartphones, possibilities for mobile data capture have grown tremendously. While these devices were initially far from rugged, more recent generations carry specifications that rival even the most rugged enterprise mobile products but are still packaged in lightweight, ergonomic form factors that make them more attractive for use in business applications. With a familiar interface and a lower price point, these “consumer grade” smartphones make compelling enterprise devices.</p><p><strong>After choosing a suitably rugged, full-featured consumer device, the next step is equipping that device with enterprise features like barcode scanning.</strong> There are many different ways to do this. Bluetooth barcode readers can be paired with mobile devices to create a scanning solution.&nbsp; There are also sleds that will wrap a smartphone in a protective case with an embedded barcode reader. Depending on your need, these may be suitable. However, if you have the right software, you could use the camera on your mobile device to read barcodes just as easily as purpose-built readers. This type of flexibility allows you to do away with the bulk and expense of extra hardware. Your workers benefit from the lighter, more ergonomic unit they’re used to and your budget benefits from not having to account for additional hardware repair costs.</p><p>Device management is another large component of rolling out an enterprise mobile solution. A comprehensive solution is needed for both provisioning devices for deployment and updating these devices once they’re deployed. The complication with mobile devices is the variety of operating systems that need to be supported. Historically, products used either proprietary operating systems or Microsoft Windows variations. As Linux started to gain popularity, devices started adopting the open source solution as their backbone. Android continues this tradition and has proliferated both the enterprise and consumer device market. Mobile device management software companies like Soti and Airwatch have added Android support to their platforms, giving businesses an option to manage Android-based consumer and enterprise devices throughout their facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple iOS support is also slowly being taken up by software vendors outside Apple to help equip iPhones, iPads, and iPods for enterprise use.&nbsp; Software packages like GroundControl provide provisioning capability and help extend traditional device management functionality to help business manage their deployed fleet.</p><p>The device management is especially important for making sure corporate data is secure and applications are limited to those required for business processes. Once these tools are in place, managers can feel comfortable that regardless of their original intention, “consumer grade” devices can be outfitted for enterprise use. The number of applications for automatic data capture now increases significantly because of the power in each worker’s hand. <strong>Areas that barcoding might not have been considered for previously due to technological or financial limitations can be outfitted with automation for faster, error-free results.</strong></p><h2><strong>Hand Crafted</strong></h2><p>User comfort should not be underestimated as a buying factor for a mobile rollout. Unlike traditional data capture solutions, devices are constantly with users. This means to encourage usage without operator fatigue, you need to consider things like unit weight, shape, and ergonomics. Also important are what accessories should be paired with a device to make it easier and more efficient for users.</p><p>In mobile data capture applications where soft scanning is used, operators have to get used to looking at the screen to locate the barcode instead of the “point and shoot” process they’re used to with legacy barcode reading products. Fortunately, there are devices like Code’s CR4300 that can give users the ability to point and shoot while still taking advantage of soft scanning. <a href="https://tachyoniq.com/software-solutions/accessories/">The CR4300 simplifies rapid scanning by eliminating the need for viewing the screen and incorporating scan buttons for better utility.</a></p><p>Other accessories help to alleviate stress, minimize damage, and promote mobility. Items like hand straps, lanyards, and shoulder straps are useful for operators who have to use and carry mobile devices all day. These types of accessories help eliminate a lot of juggling when a user has to reach for another item while trying to find a safe place to put their smartphone.</p><h2><strong>Enhanced Workstation Capabilities</strong></h2><p>Expansion of data capture applications is not limited to mobile computers. There are a large number of USB cameras on the market today with varying degrees of performance and functionality. With a flexible software decoding package, workstation PCs can be outfitted with these off-the-shelf cameras to create advanced solutions for environments where mobility is not needed or doesn’t meet performance requirements. For example, some receiving applications require scanning of individual items within a carton or pallet. With a laptop, high-resolution USB camera, and enhanced data capture software, a fixed scanning system can be designed to capture all the barcodes on the individual packages simultaneously, eliminating a tremendous amount of time and effort when tracking incoming inventory.&nbsp;</p><p>Efficiency gains from the modularity and flexibility of these workstation creations can seriously change the face of enterprise operations. The flexibility of the software is key to giving users options for the computer and the camera. The decoding solution must feature a multiple scanning option, and be robust enough to handle a wide variety of images in various lighting conditions to keep the setup as simple as possible. Otherwise, hardware costs can balloon.</p><h2><strong>Mark Everything</strong></h2><p>Choosing the right device is only part of a successful automatic data capture solution. Machine-readable media need to proliferate the enterprise to create as much efficiency as possible. The cheapest way to accomplish this is with barcodes. Most people hear the word “barcode” and immediately think of packages or labels; essentially, paper media. The extensibility of barcodes in today’s world goes well beyond just paper media. Direct part marks have been around for some time but typically required specialized expensive equipment. Today, the flexibility to mark just about anything is available for relatively little investment. This means that barcodes can be etched (via laser or chemical) or imprinted (via dot peen) onto batteries, microchips, printed circuit boards, wires, piping, tools, engine parts, and many more items.</p><p>Because most new barcode scanning technology is image-based (i.e. it takes a picture of the barcode), businesses can also use electronic barcodes to help facilitate data capture. Applications can generate these barcodes on the screen to help improve workflows for things like time tracking, member or operator check-in, payment, loyalty, and a lot of other useful applications for either promoting internal efficiency or creating a better experience for your customers.</p><p><i>Sidebar</i></p><p><strong>CR4300: Power, Protect, and Pioneer</strong></p><p>If you’re considering an iPhone or iPod for use in your business, then consider the CR4300 as well.&nbsp; This enterprise case provides durability, battery backup, and intuitive barcode scanning in a form factor that’s super compact, making it easy to use and carry.&nbsp; Unlike consumer-grade case options, the CR4300 is built with durable plastics that can withstand the rigors of the retail, manufacturing, or logistics environments.&nbsp; The case is also available with disinfectant-ready CodeShield® ruggedness for healthcare applications.</p><p>With a 3000 mAh battery and a built-in gauge to show current charge state, the CR4300 also keeps operators in motion longer and cuts down on the number of trips to the charging station.&nbsp; Between the durability and the long-lasting battery, this case is well suited as simply a backup case to protect the mobile device.&nbsp; However, Code took it one step further by integrating a patented optical platform that allows users to point and capture barcode data without having to look at the screen (similar to more traditional barcode readers).&nbsp; Left and right scan buttons have also been added to make scanning easier.&nbsp; The optical platform can be moved out of the way to allow regular picture taking, meaning the CR4300 allows full iPhone/iPod functionality while still enabling the enhancements needed to make these consumer products true business solutions.</p><p><i>Infographic suggestions</i></p><p><strong>Steps for a successful device deployment</strong></p><ul><li>Site Survey – make sure you use an expert that can make sure you choose the right product and quantity of devices and make sure your wireless network can support your needs</li><li>Provisioning – figure out a plan (internally or externally supported) for receiving devices, configuring them properly, securing them appropriately, and rolling out seamlessly</li><li>Training – Even if a device is familiar to a lot of people, the way it is intended for use in your application may be very different than traditional use.

If you operate a business that uses barcodes, you might wonder how much it really matters if a scanner can read a barcode just a fraction of a second faster. Does that added speed really impact the business value of barcode scanning?</p><h2><strong>Scan Speed Matters in Large and Small Businesses</strong></h2><figure class="image"><img src="//www.tachyoniq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Scanning-Speed-copy.jpg" alt="How fast is your scanning software?"></figure><p>Scanning speed matters on a large scale. For owners of medium or large businesses that need to scan and keep track of thousands of products, one-tenth of a second can quickly add up over days and months.</p><p>But what if your operation isn’t large enough for sub-second barcode reading to save measurable time? Should you really care how fast a barcode reads? The short answer is yes. It all centers on user productivity and satisfaction. Despite popular belief, users can distinguish even one-tenth of a second difference in scan performance. When you’re pushing for more productivity, efficiency, and profit, employees can become impatient and frustrated with minor delays when they expect instantaneous results while working to meet your expectations. Lower frustration and higher employee happiness means you have better chances for happy customers. Happy customers make running a business easier and lead to more revenue.</p><h2><strong>Advancements in Mobile Scanning</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.tachyoniq.com/software-solutions/">The development of mobile barcode scanning technology has made it easier for users to scan barcodes with speed and accuracy using only a phone or other mobile device.</a> Using older technology with a mobile camera (or even an older scanner) may create some of the following inconveniences for users:</p><ul><li>Inability to properly align the imager with barcodes in difficult spots such as near the floor or above the user’s head.</li><li>Difficulty holding the barcode within the right range for reading (some cameras cannot be used closer than 2” or further away than 4”)</li><li>Difficulty holding still enough for the camera to focus on the barcode</li></ul><p>The latest 2D barcode reading technologies have two major features that make scanning a breeze even with a handheld smartphone:</p><ol><li>As with all 2D barcode readers, they are orientation independent, so unlike older laser scanners where you had to make the red line go all the way across the barcode and the white space on either side, 2D imagers take a picture. Then the decoding software finds the barcode and decodes it instantaneously. The user no longer has alignment issues.</li><li>The newest high-performance 2D barcode readers have extreme motion tolerance, allowing them to take the image without blurring. This allows a user to trigger the scanner and then move to the barcode where it will read as soon as it is in the proper range. No stopping required.</li></ol><h2><strong>Developing a Barcoding Solution to Improve Your Business</strong></h2><p>A barcoding solution includes the creation of barcodes and the utilization of barcode scanners. For the barcodes themselves, care should be taken with their creation and physical appearance. You should examine and maintain printing and marking instruments often to confirm that high-quality, consistent barcodes are being made and applied to components to avoid no-reads. You can print barcodes using ink-based strategies like Continuous Inkjet, Thermal Inkjet, Piezo Drop on Demand, or High-Resolution Case cryptography. For these strategies, be sure to carefully verify that the printhead is positioned at the correct distance and that its nozzles are clean and unblocked. Also, make sure it is writing the barcodes at the correct speed. If you use laser coding to produce barcodes, make sure your focal distance is correct and that there is continuous power supply to the equipment to ensure high-contrast printing without losses in print distribution or speed. Thermal Transfer and Direct Thermal methods use wax or resin ribbon (or other thermal media) to apply barcodes to the substrate. In these cases, it is important to avoid ribbon wrinkles and verify the ribbon has been placed correctly into the equipment. Be sure to use high-quality ribbon or other thermal material and use quality printheads and platen rollers for evenly applied barcodes without missing elements.</p><p>For the barcode scanners, as mentioned in detail above, utilizing a software or mobile application with a complete, <a href="https://www.tachyoniq.com/2d-difference/">intelligent, and powerful SDK (i.e. Code\'s CortexDecoder)</a> will be the most crucial part. With the multi-capture functionality of a complete mobile application, you can instantly scan a group of products and move to the next, which is just another way to speed up barcode scanning—saving valuable time and enabling you to focus more of your time on other productive tasks.</p><p>We always love to chat about data capture and our amazing bundle of decoding algorithms that make scanning and decoding (even the most challenging barcodes) look easy. If you have any questions or maybe a decoding problem you just haven\'t yet been able to solve?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tachyoniq.com/contact-us/">Let\'s talk!</a></p>',
